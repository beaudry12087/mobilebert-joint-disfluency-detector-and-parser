um all right
i 've uh
as far as i 'm concerned i find that the young women have lost so much because they have become more aggressive and more dominating
and i think that comes about from their being a definite factor in the job market now
uh-huh
oh well i tend i tend to agree
uh in some ways i think it 's uh i think if anything a lot of um the changes that have occurred uh
in some ways they 're for the better
because i think women should have a choice
and i do believe in the being able to have a choice as to as far as what you would like to do with your life
but by the same token and i know this for myself because i 've worked and i 've not worked um
that it makes it uh sometimes it makes life more difficult
i think when the roles now are less defined as far as you know what uh women should or should not be doing that it it it could make life more difficult
there are more things to work out
i know when i was working you know you have all these problems with with the child care and and with uh pleasing you know your boss on the job
so you have added stresses from there
and then you still have all the things that um that you need to do at home
and that does n't change you know
just because your going out of the house for so many hours a day does n't uh make those other things go away
and the other responsibilities are still important
um
so um have you have you worked outside also and um feel that it that
well how do you feel as far as uh
what would be a happy medium
or or what would you like to see
i would like uh
yes
i have worked outside of the home
and i was in one of those safe occupations
yes
i was a school teacher
uh-huh
and we had one child when i taught for my two year career
uh-huh
uh we
uh then i stopped teaching after my husband 's business was established
and we had two children
and i stayed home with those children and raised those children
yes
and now that my husband has retired i am back substitute teaching
yes
which if anyone has ever been involved in that some days it 's fun
and some days you wonder why you 're even bothering
right
because your fighting for your life
but
yeah
but i am a fighter
and i 've always been a disciplinarian
uh i 'm i 'm not real sure that the young girls of today are being forced into the job market as many of them imply
i think they 're going in by choice
oh i think so
yes
yes
and and i have no problem with that
but i think the male needs to be the dominant person
and i think too many of the young professional wives in our small town of five thousand uh are not letting that happen
uh-huh
they are very aggressive
uh-huh
they 're uh they almost have what i would call a killer killer bee instinct
yeah
and they have to be in charge
and and i i think they lose a lot by what i call neutering their husbands
uh-huh
children well what do you think ater running
though um um
i do n't know
i
the the one problem i guess i have
and maybe what so many women younger women now are choosing to go outside is
i feel that in general in this society that being at home is not looked upon as um a job in itself
whereas you know you hear a lot of women that are home saying that it is a job in itself
but i know when i was working
and i was an engineer so i was always with men
uh and they were single many of them
and i tried to explain to them well my day does n't end when i leave at
i used to leave at three i keep going to eleven at night
uh-huh
and they had they used to look down on women that were home
they 'd say oh i bet you go home and
you know at least you get out of here at three
and you can go home and put your feet up and watch soap operas
oh sure <laughter>
and i used to be infuriated
uh-huh
because they really had no idea what was involved once i got home
now taking care of them running them everywhere helping with homework the bath the whole you know everything
um and i think that one reason that so many younger women feel compelled to go into a profession is that they feel that if they stay home they are not respected and that being home is not a respectable uh position in society
huh
and there 's a lot of truth to that
and i do n't know how you feel
i do n't know how you felt when you were home and what kind of feedback you got
but i can see with the younger men that they definitely are looking down upon women that are home
and yet by the same token i think some of it is jealousy
you you
once in a while you hear them say things like i wish i had the choice you know
uh-huh
i wish i was the one
i would stay home with my kids if my wife would go out and support us
if my wife had an education and could support us
and the only value i see coming out of this is that children now in in a two parent home they now actually have two parents
<children> uh-huh
yeah
because i see my sons-in-law
i have a daughter who 's a nurse
and i have a daughter who 's a beautician
right
and i see my sons-in-law cooking and dropping children off at the sitter and picking children up from school and and having a much better relationship with their children than my husband ever did
uh-huh
right
right
right <noise>
uh-huh
that 's true
because he left home at five thirty in the morning
that 's true
and he got home at six fifteen
yes
and uh he ate his dinner
and he was asleep in his chair because he was exhausted
right
so now the young fathers are having a chance to parent
and i think that 's an advantage
and they enjoy it
yeah
and they do enjoy it
i i see
uh-huh
you 're right
i see many more men in the supermarket in the parks with their children
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i think that is healthy because
and i think it 's a a wonderful advantage for the young for the for the particularly for the males for the little boys to have a relationship with their father
right
oh yeah
and and i do n't think you we get into so much of the mother dominating figure if if the father has more input there
yes
yeah
but uh i do n't understand why the young girls feel like they have to build roads
and they have to that kind of job uh to go out there and shovel that tar and and drive those big trucks
and we just recently finished a long drive through the west a little over five thousand miles
uh-huh
and at one point we sat down uh
i did n't realize it
but i sat at a counter to have a cup of coffee that happened to be for truck drivers only
uh-huh
and here 's this young girl with the tattoos
and she has just had just driven a load of meat from minneapolis to some place in arizona
uh-huh
and she 'd been
and i ask her how old she was
and she was the between the age of our daughters
and she had been driving a truck for seven years
uh-huh
and i thought gosh
i mean why would a woman choose that rough and tumble life-style when
yeah
i guess i 'm i 'm maybe victorian
and my husband is a little bit of a male chauvinist
in that he 's a very considerate person
but he also thinks a woman should be taken care of and and in the home
and she should vote
but after she talks to her husband about how she ought to vote
oh boy <laughter>
now it probably does n't work that way in our household because i have strong opinions about things too
yeah
but uh i like being taken care of
i like my luggage carried and my door opened
well
and i think the young women are losing that
and i think that 's sad
well that that 's true
there is that part too
and i guess we also have to examine though
and although your husband 's probably been as much conditioned as you know anybody else
he was raised in the south
um
i think that 's a little condition
i guess ha-
both
oh oh yeah
and and you have to i guess you have to question too why a lot of the men especially i think middle age and older men why they feel that way
and and i think it gets scary for them to see change also
they 've been used to being really to be honest in in society and in a way number one
and they come home
and everything 's done for them
uh-huh
huh
and their meal is served
and i think it 's frightening to them to see the roles switching
sure
and i think i think this reaction comes more out of fear
now my husband is um he 's ten years older than me
and
but he has his attitudes are very much pro-women pro-career which is kind of interesting
uh-huh
he comes from a culture where women are stay at home and do everything
uh-huh
um and yet um he 's the type that he is willing to have to take on more responsibility um if that meant oor you know for me to be able to uh uh advance or go back to work or whatever
i 'm kind of more
alking to someone in background thank you esumes talking to speaker a
i 'm kind of more middle of the road
i think that when children are small i think it 's okay for women to work especially
there should be some a lot more part time
but i think it 's um
i do n't believe in this career you know this career drive when when they 're small because i think
uh-huh
alking to someone in background they 're downstairs esumes talking to a
i think that 's very um unfair to to children
like uh engineers usually work fifty or sixty hours a week
uh-huh
huh
huh
i refused to work more than thirty
uh-huh
i was part-time
and even that was a rat race
huh
but i think you have to put in perspective that you know when the kids came home from school i wanted to be here
i did n't want i do n't want a job where i 'm traveling around and i 'm away and uh
so i think you can have both
it 's more hectic
but i think you have to put into perspective what your kids need first then
i think a lot of my problem with the young mothers
talk about the activities that we do n't do
yeah
i i do n't have any children
so
but i i have a lot of friends with children
and i know they spend a lot of time with them
which is good you know
that 's good to hear
yeah
an i haven't uh
well i 've been around a lot of people lately at at my job that do n't have a lot of values
so it 's it 's always nice to see people that like each other
and like families that get along with each other and like to do things together
yeah
have a lot of values
i love that
do they have children
uh the one the most valueless girl does n't
but she 's married
and i i 'm not quite sure why
i i think he said that he 'd give her a big ring and she got married to him
oh that 's wonderful
but it it 's kind of weighed on me
and then the other day my husband and i met a couple who who
they 're just going to have their first child
and they really like each other
and they 're real happy with one another
and she says things like i 'm really glad when he comes home
and there 's not enough time to spend with him in the evening
and
oh that 's neat
i 'm like really
that 's good you know
i like to see that
yeah
you know i have uh some friends that uh
first of all uh the girls joined
they have two girls
one joined the girl scouts
and the other was in the brownies
and then the mother got involved as a leader
and then all of a sudden the father was getting involved with doing nature hikes for them and working with the girl scout camp here in dallas and then going out to uh betty perot camp and working with the horses and stuff
and they 're gone a lot
and they take their girls
and they go away for weekends and in the winter time even you know to do work with the girl scouts
and i think it 's neat
oh yeah
you know they 've really become very much involved in in just that one organization
which the organization can use the help too
right
so i i wish i could see more of that you know
on sunday we just met uh a family
we were thinking about getting cat
and we went over to uh lady that breeds them here in town
and uh her daughter actually was
she said that her husband said to her daughter you need a hobby
so she chose the cats
oh
and you can tell it 's a family hobby
they 're all a part of it
and it was really neat because they all were interested in each other and and the cats
and they raise champion cats
so they 've done really well
ugh
those are neat cats too
yeah
i 've just learned about that breed
they 're really nice looking cats
i have seven cats
but they 're all mongrels
well that 's what we 're going to end up getting
well they 're the ones that need the homes
oh yeah
you know mine were just all uh strays in the neighborhood
little baby kittens dropped and stuff
and it just kind of built
one at a time just
i could n't you know
one time two of them came at once
and i ca n't turn a hungry cat down
oh i know
so you know
and the last one that i was here uh
the kids brought him over and said he was injured
and it was winter time
and i said i just can not have another cat
i just can not have another cat
and i looked out there
and he was just laying on my lawn just shivering and all
oh
and i said i ca n't stand it
i brought him in so
those are my children
we do n't have very many activities
but
no
i know what you mean
our cat hates other cats
and we 've tried to get her to like other cats
and she just uh she wants to be around human beings
and she does not want to be around other cats
so our next uh
we 're going to try it with a kitten and see if her maternal instincts come out
ha ha lots of luck
is she spayed
yeah
oh yeah
real maternal
we 're hoping
it 's our last hope
she 'll eventually
i mean mine you know i have five males and two females
everybody 's spayed
everybody 's neutered
and we still have a scrap every now and then
nothing real bad you know
a slap here and there
but uh they put up with each other
and they will eventually
her nose will be out of joint for a while
and she 'll hiss and growl and slap every now and then
but they 'll she 'll finally accept it
you know they really do n't have any choice
they
in my household we have a little bit of uh a fight for whose boss
i mean a male cats are are you know real territorial
and so that 's the big battle here you know
of whose whose top dog top cat i guess
uh-huh
you know but uh
i i do n't know
i do n't have a problem with it
i think they just learn to accept
and i have two dogs too
and they 've slapped the dogs around too
yeah
yeah
every now and then
so
that 's true
they 've got to keep them in line
yeah
but she 'll accept another cat eventually
as long as you make her feel uh like she 's still loved and everything
so
yeah
well those cats were great
they were fourteen pounds and
and
oh they 're just gorgeous
but yeah
it
three hundred and fifty dollars for a kitten
oh my gosh
and i think of those
i think of the kittens at the pound
yeah
three hundred and fifty dollars hispers
yeah
yeah
and they are lovely
but
till whispering ugh
house payment
right
that is a lot of money
yeah
and then she 's saying you know you ca n't let them outside
and you ca n't do all this stuff
and i 'm like ugh you know
i do n't let mine out anyway
but
i let two of them out just in the back yard every now and then
but my cats are
i 'm afraid you know the neighbors will
people throw rocks at them
and people run over them
and i i just you know i just do n't
i know
and and now they 've lost the desire
most of them do n't even try to you know to go out
i just have two that drive me crazy that i let out in the back you know
but i wo n't let them get
if they start going in the front and stuff i bring them in
oh
you know i just worry
i guess i 'm too protective
but you know
i see these cats that are wandering around the neighborhood
and too they can catch diseases really easy
yeah
yeah
just by touching a nose to another cat they can leukemia feline leukemia
so
yeah
we know we try try real hard to keep them healthy
uh we just bought uh acre a house with an acre to try to so she 'll have some room to walk around and not off of a busy street
oh how neat
we 're we 're choosing our house for our cat
isn't that bad
people do it for their children
i mean why not
oh them too
well you know why not
why not
because i she loves she 's one of those that loves outside
yeah
and and she does n't go far
but she just wants to be able to have that freedom
yeah
well if you 're off off of a you know away from a road
and
you 're off of the main road you said
yeah
yeah
away from a road you know and you keep an eye on her it 's probably okay
i 'm just real
i do n't know i guess
i 'm in a neighborhood
and it 's it 's just real tough on animals here you know
yeah
it gets hard especially with the cars
i every time i see one run over i just you know
it makes me sick
so you know
oh i know
but anyway we kind of got off the subject of children
yeah
except that i consider them my children
yeah
our cats are our kids
or
yeah
i we we got married a few months ago
and i 'm like well why ca n't ashley be at the wedding
oh no
in in her little bridesmaid dress
yeah
you know if i could have i would have
well i 'm sure it 's been done
i 'm sure it has been done
well they have weddings for dogs now and cats
and
oh
you know they have all that parties for them where they dress up
i 've seen it in magazines and stuff where you dress your animals up and take them to a
oh my
i haven't gone that far
i 'm not that bonkers
no
you know my cats do not wear clothes
an
i i do n't think they 'd like to
no
i put a bow on her one one day
and jerry just kept saying you are the meanest person
i took a picture of her
and that was all it all it lasted for
do any of your friends have have uh older children that they do anything with
do do you have friends with older children
or do they just all have young kids
um yeah
all the ones i know
my brother-in-law has three young kids seven and on down
and they they go on family vacations
and uh they go like to go skiing
the the middle girl does n't get a whole lot of attention
but uh this last ski trip they took uh she had contracted chicken pox first
and then she spread it to her her younger sister and her brother
and they got it just at the beginning of the vacation where she got better
so not only is she the better skier but she got all the attention because she got to go out
i think she planned it
she 's only five
but i think she planned it
and she got all the attention from her dad
oh see there
she needed that did n't she
oh yeah
you know it must be hard when you have a lot of children
i you know to i was an only child
my mother was an only child
so i you know i wasn't raised with brothers or sisters
and i always got all the attention
so i would n't know
i think i would be extremely jealous or would have been had there been another child in the family
yeah
it 's it 's we can see it work with her
tough
it must be tough
she 's frustrated
yeah
yeah
she she 's the middle one
yeah
so she 's never been the only one
so she really does n't even know what it is to be the only one
right
yeah
that 's tough you know
so what do you
what 's your opinion on the our policy down there
i do n't think we have one
i did n't know we had one either
yeah
i was going to say it 's kind of hard to have have an opinion
we seem to uh
whoever screams the loudest or whoever we happen to give the most money to at that particular time we seem to support without regard whether it 's a democracy or a anarchy or anything else
yeah
i do n't
yeah
the only thing that i pretty much know about is the central american policy where you know they 're just trying to you know
military action in panama is the only thing that comes to my mind right now
well uh
and then
yeah
and then of course there was there was the uh in columbia with the drug lords
right
but we just talked a lot
we did n't actually do anything
right
well that 's that 's what i was about to say
we did n't do anything
i 'm actually surprised at anything in central america along with panama
i 'm just kind of surprised we did that
yeah
but uh
that is that is pretty uh risky
i mean
especially after our friend jimmy carter gave it away anyway
uh-huh
but i guess they had to finally do something
actually bush has been better at that than i thought
uh-huh
he has a little more a little more of a stand on policy than i thought he would
i always considered him kind of a wimp
he takes more risks
yeah
reagan is kind of mushmouth
yeah
he was
but but i guess most of the policy that we 're using now is uh a combination of reagan and carter much as you know policy makers
yeah
it seems that the the policies of pretty much anywhere not just in central america that u s has now is is you know more action than just words than just rhetoric
but you know we we back up what we what we say with actions
uh yeah
we have so far
but we really haven't
i do n't know how long it 's going to last
of course we really haven't taken on the drug lords yet
yeah
i 'd be interested to see if we do that
well i do n't think it 's possible because even though you know we 're against them i do n't think we can go into another country and do something about the other country 's problem
well we did in panama
we did in saudi arabia
yeah
but
no
but see the thing when panama was uh the that uh noriega was uh was was uh was wanted either the f b i by the f b i
and therefore they had a reason
but to go in and take out the whole drug kingdom would be something totally different because
it could be an interesting interesting problem
right
i do n't know if they could do it or not
did you read tom clancy 's a clear and present danger
uh no
i did n't
i think you need to pick that up and read it
it 's quite uh it 's it 's quite interesting
it addresses the problem
oh the drug problem
uh-huh
uh-huh
actually he he wrote that prior to the uh medellin cartel being exposed
it was on the stands prior to that time
it it 's quite timely
and either he knows somebody
or he has a real good a real good imagination
because its it hits pretty close to home
yeah
but i do n't think we 're going to have much of a choice in either central or south america
i do n't think uh i do n't think the the uh problem about drugs is going to be safe any time soon
i mean you know it i think it pretty much got sidetracked with uh with the panama and and with the middle east problems
things that that are important take precedent precedence over the drugs i think
i think i think the big thing is trying to stop here on the home front
and
you know it it 'll take a little bit of time before they 'll realize that this is failing
so they 're going to have to go to the source
um yeah
i think we realize it 's failed
we just do n't we just do n't
nobody wants to make the nobody wants to make the unpopular decision of going in and invading
don't want to admit it yet
right
we still there 's still there 's still too many kennedys and and all up there
yep ause
yeah
that 's true
there 's too many liberals in control
they ca n't agree on anything
and they have blinders on as far as the policy goes
as long as somebody 's getting killed as long as nobody knows about it it 's okay
but but the minute it hit hits the paper then of course the kennedys and the and the and the and uh the from georgia all stand up and scream and yell about what a horrible thing it is
yeah
of course these are the same people that also drown the chappaquiddic and stuff like that you know
huh
but i guess it
i guess it 's automatic respective
depends on how much power you have and who you know
yeah
you know the people have a right to know except about what it about what concerns them
yeah
and these are the people that make the foreign policy
and it it 's probably basically uh
i would not be surprised if the kennedy foundation or some of those do n't have a lot of uh financial holdings in in central and south america
probably
considering the kennedys made all their money off bootleg whiskey anyway
huh
every time you drink scotch you 're paying kennedys
i do n't drink scotch
good
don't ever drink scotch
it 's terrible
i quit drinking scotch when i found out about that
but anyway
but uh as far as as far as you know central and south america we our policy pretty much uh it depends on who we 're what government we 're buying down there at the particular time
yeah
i think we 're trying to stay uh stay friendly with uh the uh the brazilian and and argentinean governments because they 're producing so much uh agricultural exports
we
we do n't want to piss them off and have them over produce
yeah
although we do need to do something about you know
of course in nicaragua and around there with the sandinistas and the contras that 's been going on for years
but then hell it 's probably still be going on long after we 're dead
it 'll still be the same thing
those people down there do n't really
i mean
i think it 's going to have to get worse before it gets better
you know the same old cliche
well i think basically they ca n't figure out what they want down there
right
if you give everybody what they wanted there is a complete democracy those people would n't know how to react because they have no education
right
and they 'll just pick crooked people again
and then people the the wrong people will just fight their way up to the top again
and it 'll all be for nothing
it 's all tradition
it 's all traditional
they have to
you have the ruling class
and you have everybody else
yeah
well i guess that 's about five minutes
appreciate talking to you
was very pleasant))
all righty
good talking to you
hey what was that book
what was that book that you were saying to read again
tom clancy
it 's called a clear and present danger
a clear and present danger
uh-huh
he he 's the one who wrote uh red october a hunt for red october
okay
all right
and i think if you read that i think you 'll get a real kick out of it
all right
thanks a lot
all righty
bye-bye
bye
clanking ishes oman and children
well as much as i 'd uh i 'd like to say that i 'll be looking for a flashy convertible or uh or a four by four or something
i guess the next car i 'll be looking for is a kind of a plain old four door
what kind of a car do you have now
oh we 've got a uh an older delta eighty-eight
and then uh our our newer car is a uh a corsica
yeah
and we 'll probably be looking for something about that uh that same style
yeah
that same kind of four door hard top style
you got kids
uh no
but we 're planning for it
okay
so uh in fact uh our oldsmobile is a is a like an old delta eighty-eight
but it 's in pretty good in really good shape
yeah
and we 've been really pleased with oldsmobiles
yeah
so that 's probably where the first place we 'd look
huh
but uh
well we 've always had uh fords
uh-huh
uh mostly because my wife 's stepfather works at a ford dealership
that 'll do it
yeah
that 'll do it
um but yeah we 're we 're in the same shape
i think our next car will be a you know some big old four door uh something that can haul the kids to baseball practice and piano lessons
yeah
and we 've got a minivan
uh-huh
and that 's great
and i drive uh
well i used to drive an escort
but it died on me
so i i mean i i i used to run it i uh where we used to live i used to commute a hundred and forty miles a day
oh geez
and uh and this escort took it all
and it it it got up to uh uh i was at ninety-four thousand miles on it
and the engine just went
uh-huh
so i i i bought a used uh dodge aries which has been okay
yeah
really
i i mean i 've haven't had it that long
uh-huh
but it it it 's an eighty-five aries
but it only had thirty-four thousand miles on it when i bought it
oh geez
and i just you know i just drive it to work
so it 's just a ten minute commute every day
uh-huh
so uh it does n't get much of uh
i mean it 's not like i 'm putting it through its paces
yeah
yeah
but i think uh
and it 's a four door which is nice
uh-huh
but it 's still a little cramped
i 've got three kids
yeah
so i i
sounds like you you need at least like a taurus size or something like that
yeah
that 's what i was thinking of
was a taurus
uh
yeah
i i know a lot of guys at work
they uh the ones that have uh families uh
and they still want kind of a sports car
they 've been uh a lot of them have been getting these taurus s h o 's
that i guess it 's the sports version of the taurus
oh really
yeah
in fact it comes with a standard stick
and uh and a lot of those
ooh
and it comes with a bigger engine and the things like that
but uh
yeah
and usually they 're in like black and gun metal grey and those kind of colors
you 're not going to see too many uh you know green ones or blue ones or anything like that
yeah
they they put them in sporty colors i guess
but uh
yeah
well my wife wants a miyata
oh well sure
that 's what you know
until until you look at the price tag
and then you go what
right
what would i besides tooling around and looking really cool and having a lot of fun what would i really do with this car
right
yeah
i know
i know
it 's like i i guess i could fit in it maybe
yeah
i i went i went through that when i first got out of uh college
i had an old car that i bought just to get to to my my first job
yeah
and when i got there the first thing i did was trade it in on a spitfire
oh
and i i knew that was going to be the only time i could afford a two seater uh sports car
yeah
but that that just does not make it as an only car
it 's uh it 's like i i would
i bought a set of stereo speakers
yeah
and it was one of those cash and carry deals
i had to take them one at a time with the top down
and it was winter so i was in like this coat with the top down
oh no
and the speaker in the passenger seat
yeah
and i drove that one home
and then i went back and got the other one and put that in the passenger seat and drove that one home
and uh funny funniest sight
and you kind of outgrow that real quick when it 's your only car
yeah
yeah
well i
you know it 's funny
most people that i 've talked to did stuff like that when they were in college or you know or when they were single anyway
uh-huh
yeah
they 'd they 'd buy themselves a sporty car because it was their last
i never did that
uh you know my first car was a toyota corolla
oh really
and uh because i got a good deal on it
yeah
and uh that was a great little car
actually i met
that 's how i met girls was i 'd find out if a girl could drive a manual transmission which i i had never
i i 'd learned on an automatic transmission and so so i 'd go out on dates where they would teach me how to drive this car
uh-huh
boy that 's a good deal
and uh in fact i married one of those people
ah okay
well i 'll have to remember that if i ever get in that situation again
and it worked
yeah
it worked all right real good
huh
because i i know we 've uh
that 's that 's something that that we definitely have to go with is an automatic transmission
my uh my wife just ca n't ca n't uh
she really does n't want to learn i guess the uh the standard shift
yeah
yeah
i fact i i remember once we uh we uh went uh went on a uh test drive
we got one of these things from lee iacocca that said you know i 'll give you a fifty dollar savings bond if you 'll test drive a car
yeah
yeah
and we went uh we went uh we went to a dealership
and uh it it was she she did pretty well
but it was one of those things where we just went to a big parking lot
yeah
and the uh dealer kind of gave her standard shift parking
because that was all it was
it was it was the funniest thing
it was like uh a big le baron
it was a le baron with everything on it
wow
but it had a standard shift
it was the craziest thing i ever saw
that 's weird
yeah
and and and that 's probably why they were trying to sell them i guess
huh
and uh we just kind of went back and forth and back and forth
she did pretty well after a while
yeah
but uh it 's just kind of hard to learn i guess
well my wife
i mean she 'd always driven standard transmission
uh-huh
and uh and
in fact all our earlier cars were a standard transmission
in fact the minivan 's a has a stick shift
um okay
and in
this dodge aries is the first car we 've ever gotten that had anything
you know it 's got automatic transmission cruise control you know electric locks
oh geez
you know it 's like it 's like a luxury car except that it 's the dodge aries you know
yeah
yeah
so uh
oh well
well i guess that 's i guess that 's about all i 've got to say about cars
well you um
the the thing about this uh
i will say this about the minivan
uh-huh
we thought that was a luxury car when we bought it
uh-huh
i would think so
yeah
it it
because it 's so big
yeah
and and it was quiet
it had a stereo system
oh yeah
we never had it you know
we always had the a m radio
sure
sure
and uh of course this has this that had speakers that you can control from the back seat
uh-huh
and you can change the channels on the on the radio from the back seat too
uh-huh
and put speaker phones in it
so
now now now that used to be a luxury
but i bet on the next time you buy a car that 's going to be mandatory
right
you 've got to have that now
that 's right
that 's right
you 're used to it
and you got to have it
and you 've got to pay for it too
yeah
that 's true too
and i bet and i bet it costs twice as much as as when i bought mine
it it probably does
it probably does
but uh
we
oh well
well bill it 's been nice talking to you
nice talking to you
okay
you have a good evening
thanks a lot
um
bye-bye
bye-bye
what kind
what kind of cars do you do you usually drive
right now we i 've got a uh four year old subaru and a two year old honda
oh my goodness
well we 're we 're we 're sort of sort of a general motors family
i guess that 's the way we were raised
and uh uh we were overseas with t i for a number of years
and when we came back we suddenly find out we 've got five licensed drivers in the family
oh goodness
yeah
and four cars
and we bought some year old cars from national car rental
really
at least two of them
we bought an olds calais and a buick skylark
uh for you know
they each had twenty-one thousand miles or something like that
uh-huh
turns out that 's a pretty good place to buy cars because they maintain them
and they can show you the records they 've gotten all their maintenance on schedule and everything like that
uh then we 've got an eighty-six chevy spectrum that we bought new
my daughter was a freshman in college when we bought it for her
uh-huh
and we 've got a eighty-four toyota that we bought used
so we 've got four cars for our five licensed drivers
it 's like musical chairs
i bet
you 're one short
i bet
and uh
but you know it 's interesting the two
even though my dad was a chevrolet man forever and ever and ever
and we were in the retail milk business
and he had all chevrolet milk trucks
and and we bought automobiles and all that
it was almost like
and a chevrolet dealer was our friend
and it was almost like the minute we got old and bought anything like a but a chevrolet it would be like going and spitting on his grave
but uh
yep
as we got older and got away
and then we thought well you know you still could buy general motors products
and it was probably not that bad
but uh we lived in malaysia for t i in nineteen uh eighty-one two three and four
uh-huh
and and of course you do n't buy general motors products over there
no
but we bought a volvo
and i have never had a car that i 've loved more
i just ca n't afford them here
uh but i i just loved that car
uh-huh
and uh we bought a uh
we lived in the philippines for t i in eighty-five eighty-six and eighty-seven
and we bought a uh ford telstar
which is somewhat similar to the taurus
it 's sold in uh in uh the far eastern uh far east countries more than here
uh-huh
but we really liked that
and have you had experience with cars other than the ones you have
well yeah
we had uh we had
these are the first cars that my husband and i have ever purchased ourselves
um
the others were hand me downs through the families
yeah
and those were always g m cars
yeah
uh buicks and chevrolets
uh-huh
and uh we were real happy with them
but all the ones that we ever had were the you know eight cylinder
oh yeah
really rugged g m cars
the the big
yeah
and all we had heard was was a lot of negative press about the smaller cars
and we both drive well forty-five miles round trip every day
sure
sure
and so we wanted a smaller car
yeah
when we got ready to buy we needed a smaller car to get better gas mileage
and quite frankly we were afraid of the of the g m small cars
uh-huh
uh-huh
you know as far as durability
right
so we kind of
when we had our larger cars we did n't mind uh keeping them up
uh-huh
you know doing the maintenance and everything on them as long as we did n't have to do it very often
yeah
but once they got over a hundred thousand miles on them all of them you know
it just kind of seemed to be the magic number for them
yeah
yeah
it seems that something goes every month
yeah
it
and i 'm afraid we 're going to be in that in another year with all of ours
you know
we got three eighty-sixes and an eighty-four
uh-huh
and we 'll probably be there with all of them
you know it 's the same thing you know
i do n't know whether uh you classify the skylark and the calais as
well i guess they 're intermediate
uh-huh
uh but uh we went on a family trip to massachusetts
and there were five of us
and five five of us never go anywhere together here
everybody 's heading off in their own direction
right
and i rented a buick le sabre
uh-huh
and it 's the first big car i had since i had my nine passenger impala station wagon from seventy-six to eighty
and it made all the
i i had forgotten what driving a big car was like
it 's like a yacht
it was just nice
it floated
yeah
what
we we sold or we we traded in our le sabre for our subaru
oh yeah
yeah
it was a great car
yeah
it just
we ran the wheels right off of it
yeah
yeah
yeah
and uh you know i 've read
i 'm in the quality business at t i
i 'm a quality manager
and we 're we 're uh we deal
we sell
i 'm in the semiconductor group
and we sell to uh ford chrysler and g m uh g m delco
uh-huh
and there is a amazing
i am just uh really impressed with the with the quality consciousness that the these companies have put into their procurement
and it 's i it 's come out as a result of the competition from the japanese
uh-huh
and uh uh i
and you know we used to think ford products were tinny
i mean i was growing up
i was taught when i was growing up you know that that that real people bought general motors products
and peons bought ford products
that 's right
but just with the quality requirements that ford is putting on us and the way they come into our plants
and they 're really uh uh stressing this partnerships in quality
and you know g m and chrysler are doing that
but i really think ford 's got a ship position in this right now
and i think it 's showing up in their automobiles
their automobiles are getting a very good quality reputation right now
uh-huh
and uh uh we went to uh austin a while back to a basketball tournament
and we were going to be meeting some of my wife 's relatives down there
so we decided rather than drive one of our cars down we 'd rent one
uh-huh
and we went up to the local budget
and we were going to get a olds eighty-eight or something
he said i 'll tell you what for a dollar a day more i 'll give you a lincoln town car
um
and we drove that down
and i hated to turn that back in
i bet
we had that for three days
and i absolutely loved
except i could n't want to have to park it in tight places all the time
no
uh
i would n't want to have to pay for the gas either
but i absolutely loved that automobile
and you know it wasn't that i 'd
driving around down there we might have got sixteen to eighteen miles per gallon
but on the trip down and back i filled up both coming and going
so i knew what i actually got on the trip
and it was about twenty-four miles a gallon
uh-huh
uh and you know we just got it out on the highway and put it in cruise control at about sixty and let it let it float
uh-huh
and it was pretty nice
are are are you planning on getting any additional or other cars
no time soon
uh we 're our our we wo n't have any more licensed drivers for about thirteen years
um
oh yours is small
yes
so we uh so we do n't plan on purchasing any more any time soon
both of our cars are getting oh around sixty thousand miles on them
um
oh yeah
we drive a lot
yeah
you got another another thirty or forty thousand if you maintain them
uh-huh
uh we 've got
probably we 'll get something in the next couple years
my son will graduate from high school this year
and and he 's going to go to richland college one year behind us
uh-huh
it 's right
in fact uh our house is adjacent to the richland property
he wants to go to texas tech
and he 's probably going to have to go to richland a year to get some grades in order
but uh the next year when he goes out to tech he wants a pickup
and i want a pickup
a pickup aint
i may get one and not let him have it
but we have been looking at these red
they they 're very popular around here
uh-huh
these uh uh red chevy pickups
and uh we 'll probably do something like that
uh uh incidentally
uh uh i do n't know
uh the uh the credit union has got a deal now where you decide what you want
and you call this number
and uh they go negotiate the price for you
and and or or send you to a guy with whom they 've already got a deal
uh-huh
and uh my boss just bought a chevy pickup
and he got three thousand dollars off the sticker price doing it this way
really
yeah
and uh uh you know you you figure out the options go around look at the dealers and get the best price you can and then go call this guy and and tell him what you want
and he 'll put you in touch with a certain guy a certain person at that dealer 's place
uh-huh
so i 'm going to try that the next time i buy one
i think that would be a good idea
and and so you know i can go around and comparison shop and see if i can get a better negotiation on my own
but once one thing that 's a pain in the neck buying automobiles is negotiating
yeah
i 've we 've we 've we 've kind of been the types that will say this is what we intend to spend
yeah
this is the car we want
will you sell me this car for that price
and for that price
and and we 've had
we with our
when we bought our subaru the guy was like you ca n't do this to me
and we 're were just like okay fine we we wo n't then
we 'll go somewhere else
yeah
you know
i mean he 's like no no no
yeah
but
and uh and i i think that 's probably the way you 've got to do it
when when i was young i went in and bought a uh or made a deal on a sixty
this is nineteen sixty
i 'd first come to texas and made a deal on a sixty red impala convertible that i just loved
uh-huh
uh-huh
and this guy gave me this deal you know
i told him how much i wanted to pay
and for every fifty dollars he 'd have to go in and check with the boss
and then i 'd have to sign something saying that if he could get this rate uh we would go ahead and buy
uh uh if he could get this rate i promised to buy
and i left there on a saturday afternoon just totally exhausted
i i was only twenty-five years old or something
uh-huh
i i left there
and i i uh i 'd never done this before because i 'd always bought my previous cars from the guy my dad bought his milk trucks from
and uh uh so i i got back
and a salesman that lived in the apartment had asked me uh uh if
he 'd heard i was going to get a car and asked me what i paid for it
he said well hey uh before you go buying anything
he says call this friend of mine at will 's point
there was a guy that owned a chevrolet dealership up there
uh-huh
and i called the guy and made an appointment to come up monday morning
and just driving fifty miles out of town it was a difference
and i mean it was a difference of four hundred dollars
but this was four hundred dollars on only twenty-five hundred
goodness
is all we paid for cars in those days
and uh uh so i called back the guy in dallas
and i told him that
i 'd left him a check for tax title and license and everything
and i said i want to cancel my order and and do n't try to cash the check because i 'm going to i 've stopped payment on it already
and he says oh somebody 's taking
he said what did you get a deal for bill
and i told him
he says somebody 's taking you for a ride
and i said no somebody took me for a ride last saturday
that 's right
and uh uh and i i find that uh
and for the longest time then i drove up to will 's point
and and the and the fellow died since then
and and some of his relatives have taken over the business
and that
but
and since then i had
uh our children are both uh basically adults
they we 've we 've got two
uh one is twenty-one
and one is twenty-five
uh-huh
and they they still live at home
uh-huh
well that 's that 's a little unusual for uh for children of that age to have both of them that age at home
but uh i guess the activities that uh we have with them are uh pretty few and far between
actually the they 're both going on their own most of the time
uh-huh
so uh most of our activities are you know just discussion type things about what 's going on in the family and what they 're doing and that kind of thing
uh-huh
well we have a uh three year old and a one year old
and uh so you know it keeps us pretty busy as you know
sure it does
and uh most of the time with a three year old we 're trying to to get him uh
well we play usually in the evening when when i get home you know about five o'clock or so until about eight you know with the exception of dinner
out in the front or backyard playing like uh tee ball off the you know off the ball and let him hit a lot of baseball
uh since we just got here we got the uh uh new two wheel bike with training wheels on it for him
and he really likes riding that around
uh-huh
oh yeah
i
so you know
and trying to supervisor him with that and everything and uh playing squirt guns and all that
he really likes that
yeah
and uh the one year old just kind of follows along and does everything
trying to do everything he does
yeah
is the one year old a boy
no
it 's a girl
a girl
yeah
ours uh the older one is a girl
so
and the and the younger one is a boy
so
yeah
uh i guess uh what i see is so far as uh the trends uh uh for children uh
i do n't know what kind of a area virginia beach is
but of course uh richardson is in the dallas area
uh-huh
and i think uh the big city uh
activities for for children now are
they 're good
but there 's so much uh potential danger you know
that you really have to watch your children so closely now
that you ca n't let them grow up the way the way i grew up you know
uh-huh
i i 'm from a smaller town in east texas
and i could you know go and do whatever pretty much whatever i wanted to do uh my whole life
uh-huh
uh you know i never never had to worry about the bad guys being out there
uh-huh
and uh you know i find it 's it 's quite a bit different now
that uh you know you have to watch your children so closely and uh keep up with them
i i feel like uh
that it 's it 's really a sad commentary on uh you know a life in general
uh-huh
that uh you know that children ca n't cannot be allowed to grow up uh you know without really close supervision
well i i agree with that
and i seem i seem to feel the same way you know
even just when i grew up and everything
and and the way it is now you get a lot of supervision is is at hand and everything
uh-huh
uh the only other thing i have noticed though is that uh it seems that there 's been a lot of or more emphasis at least in what we 've been dealing with
and and the looking you know
just start not even
not really looking for a school for him but uh like a preschool or something that where he would go maybe a couple hours a couple days a week or something
uh-huh
for for a three year old it 's that uh
there 's a lot of emphasis on on on on education and what these children should know before they reach kindergarten
right
and and it seems like it 's a lot more than they need to know and be able to do than when we are the when i had to go in kindergarten
yeah
and it seems like it 's more uh
you know i do n't know
they 're expecting more or uh or just uh you know
kids just because of the computer age or whatever it just know more when they get you know to be five or six or something
yeah
but
um i guess looking at uh back at at what our children did compared to what uh you know what i had to go through in school
the uh there there does seem to be a lot more in the curriculum
it 's a lot more complicated
a lot more available of course
uh-huh
but uh this
so much more to learn now that it really makes it more difficult i would think
i i would probably have a hard time getting through school myself
uh-huh
uh you know just
or at least it would be a lot harder than it was when i went to school
uh-huh
one thing is i got a home computer too
and uh i play uh with the three year old
i play some computer games and stuff with him
uh-huh
educational games like you know concentration type games the matching things like that
right
yeah
and uh he 's he really likes it
and uh and i think it 's important because i think that uh you know it gives him the interaction with the computer
because it sure looks like that 's going to be you know the big thing for a long time
huh
and given given that knowledge and stuff with it
yeah
i think uh
and he seems to enjoy it
ery faint oh
and uh of course the one year old hasn't hasn't gotten there yet
but uh
and the other thing we try to do is uh since the here is uh sign him up for and her for uh different activities at like the rec center or something like swimming
right
you know uh
or
there 's a little soccer thing that he 's going to do for a week or so
and uh you know
where they go for an hour or so
yeah
and uh
because uh when he was a baby that we did the swimming too
and he really liked it
so we 're going to do that with our daughter too
yeah
that uh uh watching a little little boys play soccer is is more fun
i ca n't imagine them having as much fun as the parents had watching them
i know
well we were just talking about that too
and i guess it 's not really soccer it 's just kind of a well kick the ball around for a while see what happens
right
yeah
the the disorganized play really what it was
but but uh
yeah
yeah
when ours was a
he
i guess he was probably five or six you know when he first started playing soccer
uh-huh
and uh and that was that was more fun to watch those boys trying to trying to kick the ball up and down the field
uh-huh
but uh
and it 's
i guess that was you know as important uh as much important to the parents as it was to the children that uh you know to get out and watch the kids play
so
uh-huh
i guess one of the things that i think about is a talking about education uh i kind of feel like uh that uh the the school systems in this particularly in this area the systems are not under enough control
the the students have a little too much uh too much leeway
uh-huh
excuse me
um and the and that 's kind of contradictory to what i said
but you know you
the
you have to be under control so much when they 're out
but when they 're in school they they do n't have quite quite as much control over them as uh as what i would liked to have seen
right
right
right
uh-huh
uh uh i kind of feel like there 's there 's too much allowed to go on in at at school
uh-huh
and uh you know it tends to uh to encourage students to not be as you know to not concentrate as much on the education
uh-huh
you know they 're they 're there for a good time
right
and you know to to see how little they can get by with
uh-huh
well i know of number of people that are in the in the uh school district down in in uh san antonio
and uh it seems like it 's
a lot of the problem is to you know
you always have the lack of funds
but it seems to be getting worse and worse
and so they do n't settle the resources to draw on to give as much supervision as as as kids need
right
and uh you know that 's just a problem that who knows how that 's going to that 's going to come out or anything
but uh
but
ery faint yeah
but uh i i do n't i do n't know
i think uh you know some of the thing has to do with uh with the civil rights program
not that the civil rights program is bad
but that there 's
it carried over into you know individual rights
uh-huh
and it you know trickled
well tom just tonight i was working on my car out of necessity
and i had uh uh had a long age-old problem of my bright lights not working
uh this is the type of uh switch where you flip the the lever the turn signal on the column
yeah
and when i would uh put it in the bright light position the lights would go out completely
which is even worse than them just not getting bright
exactly
and i had presumed that it was the switch
and uh this is uh an older car
it 's a seventy-two m g
so i had to mail order the part uh
which i had done
and tonight i went out and uh at least hooked in the new part only to discover that that apparently is not the problem
it 's not in the switch because it does the same thing with the new switch
oh
so i 'll be faced with having to return that product and uh hoping that uh you know that they will accept it
although it 's been removed from the box it 's obviously not been really used
did you do the diagnosis or was it just an assumption that that 's probably the part that failed
uh i had done what diagnosis i could primarily by looking at a wiring diagram that i did have of the car and uh pretty much decided that that had to be the problem
uh-huh
i talked to one mechanic about it
and he suspected the switch also
uh but i 've not you know
i really do n't know what the problem might be
it it the other switch could be the main switch itself uh that turns the lights on or off which is on the dashboard
uh-huh
uh it might be tied into the equation somehow
but
yeah i know
uh when working with the uh flashers there is uh usually a a special fuse that operates the flashers
do you have a separate fuse for your high beam as opposed to your low beam
i i do n't know
i should look at that
i do n't remember seeing one in the uh in the diagram
diagram
so i 'll have to go back and look at that
yeah
i do n't even know if my current cars have a separate fuse
i know sometimes when you think there are things running while they 're at the same unit like the headlamp
uh-huh
you tend to think well there 's one fuse operating the whole thing
but sometimes the extra amperage that a high beam drives as opposed to a low beam requires uh the use of a of a maybe a higher fuse
yeah
that 's a good idea
so that 's a possibility
what i 've typically found when that uh
companies are pretty good about accepting returns on products like that when they 're not needed after all
and i hope that that 's the case this time
is this a a mail order parts house that specializes in in parts for parts for uh old imports
right
exactly
who
it 's out of kansas somewhere
um
so it 's not j c whitney or somebody like that
no
it 's not
i also got a piece of chrome for the the hood that they had indicated was the right part for this car
but it is not either
it 's obviously does n't quite fit
so it must be for a different year
so i 'll have to try to return that as well
yeah
have you found any uh uh reliable import service people in the metroplex
well i had one person that i used for years and years on this car
because i 've owned this car since it was new
and uh
but it 's over like in the brook hollow industrial district down on stemmons and inwood area
oh yeah
uh-huh
and i hadn't used him for some years
and the last time i called him back it turned out that he had further specialized
instead of uh all import cars he has narrowed it down to where he only works on uh german cars and ause german cars
i 'll be darned
i 'm not sure that he works on much else at all
but he does n't work on british cars any more and gave me the name of somebody else to take a look at it
so uh uh i may have to check with that person
as it turns out that one that shop is near where i now work
so i 'll uh i should be able to take it in and check that part out
i 've not had to exchange any other parts recently because they were defective
now i 've had had pretty good luck
i just however did uh have to get a a uh one of these jam box portable dual cassette players uh repaired
uh-huh
i purchased it at sam 's
and i had assumed that it had a ninety day warranty
and i should have checked more carefully and done a better job of saving the receipt
because i did n't take it in right away and let a whole year go by
uh some of the buttons did n't work right where you had to actually physically hold them down to get it to record or to play
and as it turned out it had a full year 's warranty
and i could have gotten it repaired for free
but i had to take it in
oh my goodness
while it was in the shop i ended up finding the receipt that i thought had long since been lost
uh but it did n't do me any good because i had i had missed the window by about a week or two
oh no
so i did n't even i did n't really uh even bring it up when i went in to pick it up
but uh that 's really my only experience in the past year where i 've had to take a product back because of a defect
well ours wasn't within the last year
i guess it 's been within the last two years uh
judy has an oldsmobile that we bought new
and it 's one with the uh electronic ignition and the computer controlled mixer and uh
i do n't know what else it all controls but the fuel mixture and cruise control and things of that sort
and we found that the uh uh we were having two problems
it was idling fast when you first started the engine to the point that we park on a hill under our car port
and it when you first dropped it into geared it would immediately want to back up into the alley
and knowing that you always had to keep your foot on the brake hard
otherwise it would just wrench control away from you
good grief
and the other problem judy would have is occasionally she would uh be driving along uh decelerating like coming to a stop sign but not yet stopped at the stop sign
uh-huh
and the engine would just quit
so we took it back to the uh oldsmobile place and asked them to check it out
and at first they thought it was just a matter of timing
so they adjusted timing
and the problem did n't go away
so we ended up taking it back again
and i do n't know why they do n't look at these things the first time around
but the second time around they looked at their uh recall service and their service reports from region or headquarters whatever
and and they had a description of the exact problem we were experiencing that apparently was a programming error in the uh computer control unit
huh
which fortunately they replaced under warranty because it was about a three hundred or three hundred and fifty dollar part
my goodness
and uh so once they replaced it then the the car seemed to work fine for a considerable period of time
huh
and now it seems to be
we we 're not experiencing the stalling
but we 're still experiencing a very uneven
okay
what do you think about it
uh well immigration
i know they 're really strict right now because my husband is from out of the country
and uh we had to go through a whole very long process to uh to assure the government that he was uh marrying me and not to be a resident here
uh-huh
that 's
yeah
i think that 's uh i think it 's a little crazy
i worked with spanish people for about two years
uh-huh
and just it was incredible to me to see the things that they had to go through when they were really some of the best workers
yeah
that 's true
i mean you ca n't just come over to the country because uh you want to
right
you know that 's not good enough
you have to have a have to have a darn good reason of political or whatever
right
exactly
not a good not a good easy way to get in
yeah
i think you know i think in a lot of ways the law is good because it tries to to protect you know the people who are in the states
exactly
my mother uh actually knew a woman in another state that used to marry men just
uh-huh
she 'd never even meet them
and she 'd just get money for it
oh you 're kidding
huh-uh
so
sounds like a lot of fun
yeah
it 's amazing to me how how many things they would allow to occur before you know you can come in
exactly
but i mean with the new laws it 's it 's tough now
right
yeah
it 's kind of frustrating too for those who are legitimate now
exactly
you know i think
well and you know uh my grandparents came to this country just wanting a better life you know
uh-huh
and they got here
but now it 's a you know it 's so strict that you ca n't just do that
right
exactly
and i think it 's important that they you know they allow a good number of people in every year
because really they 're the ones who work the hardest and do the jobs that that we do n't want to do
i agree
and i just
i do n't know
i have personally i have a problem with it
i think that you know if someone wants to come in and they can prove that they 're going to work and they 're going to be a good citizen that we should n't close our door
exactly
if they 're not going to be on welfare or or or whatever
they 're going to be a productive citizen zen
and you know i i believe that if someone goes on welfare that 's when you you know send them back to their country
yeah
and i think a lot of times we 're so busy trying to keep them out that we 're spending twice as much money as we would just allowing them in
and
well think of how many illegal aliens have have have been uh uh sent back to mexico just to find their way back
yeah
and that 's that 's what i think
you know i i have to laugh
because like i said i worked with a lot of those
and they 'd been deported two or three times
and just basically what they do is they get caught when they wanted to go home for christmas or for any other time
that 's right
that 's our money
yes
that 's true
but i think you know i think all in all there 's a lot of improvements
i think the general idea is good
but but there could be some work done in the area
i i think
i i agree
well good
anyway do you have anything else in the the subject uh that you might want to talk about
uh i uh
boy
this is spur of the moment uh
but i i do n't really see any any changes that i think of really blatant right now
other than i think they ought to take you know on a case by case basis and not necessarily make it a uh political refugee
yeah
absolutely
i think a lot of times we take you know basically who we want to
because if you if you have connections it 's a lot easier to get in
exactly
connections and money
yeah
and i think you know it should be more of a thing that 's based upon someone 's intent you know and that it should be equal to all
yeah
and then not like the united states
basically it 's not who you know
it it does n't become a thing of who you know but but how the type of person you are
i agree
and it should be based on those kinds of things so the good people like probably your husband can get in
yeah
well we got him past that
but uh
well great
i know there 's a lot of other people out there would probably do a good job here
yep
well let 's see
is there anything i believe in
i think that 's it
is this like a very short call
no
i 'm not sure how long they 're supposed to be
but i 've enjoyed it
it 's good hearing your your point of view
and i think that 's neat
i think we agree a lot on that
and i 've learned something from it
i did too
well it was nice talking to you
well thanks
i 'm glad you 're home
you have a good evening all right
you too
thanks
bye-bye
bye
well seems to me the one of the reasons that people do n't go out to vote is maybe they 're bored with the whole election process
well i agree with the boredom of the election process
but i also uh think that people do n't realize that their boat vote will make a difference
uh they feel like that you know it 's going to go however it 's going to go
and their one little vote is not going to make that much difference
and it 's just why make the effort
well sometimes strangely enough one vote has made the difference
well i agree with that
and i and i do know that you know all those votes are counted
and and they do make a difference
uh also i think that people have a tendency to to vote in the larger elections and not vote in the the more local elections
well it 's kind of strange
because in the local elections is the ones that have the most influence on their day-to-day lives
exactly
and i i even have a tendency to do that myself
and i have to really make a concerted effort to to get involved
i live i live in a suburb in mesquite
and uh so i really have to make an effort to read the local paper and to see what 's going to because that directly affects me
but i i think on the whole most people do n't uh feel that way
or do n't look even look at that
i think they just do n't even
i i do n't think they 're conscious of it
well maybe part of the problem is they do n't they think they have enough choices
well that may be true too
i hadn't thought of that
you know in some of the european countries they have numbers of parties that run
and then lot of more voters come out to vote than vote in this country
uh-huh
right
and sometimes it 's uh
well not sometimes but many times it 's who has the most money to spend on the largest campaign
and and issues get uh bogged down
well maybe it 's a matter of you know voter awareness
uh i think voter awareness
i i did some work for the uh women 's league of uh voters uh several years ago
and i think there are some organizations that used to uh do some voter awareness uh things
they do n't get a lot of participation
they do n't get a lot of uh activity
most of the league of women voters what they did was they put out information so that it it would just be made available to everyone
now other areas that i 've worked in like in the chambers they would just have the candidates come
and it would just you know
that was not a lot of community involvement
and those were people that would mostly vote anyway
well i think part of the problem is the election goes on way too long
in britain you know they have a set period of time
and and for campaign that 's it
in this country it seems like it 's a continuous ongoing campaign
it 's a it 's an ongoing campaign
and it 's expensive campaign
and it it uh eliminates a lot of qualified people
uh maybe more qualified and uh more dedicated to the issues
well the they do n't want to spend the time
or they do n't have the money
exactly
exactly
and it it
i i ca n't i just ca n't believe
i 've i 've worked in a couple of local campaigns
i just cannot believe the dollars that are spent just even locally
well it 's a matter of name recognition
people aren't going to vote for someone they 've never heard of
oh well i agree with that
but also
and i and i 'm not for controlling how much is spent
but do you know
that 's one thing
if a if the time wasn't so
if it wasn't such a long uh campaigning time then they could n't spend as much money
and even debates do n't seem to help much
no
they really do n't
uh it 's it 's a lot of it is who looks the best who uh who happens to say the right thing at the right time who not who may not be the most qualified and can get the uh the job done
so we 're really voting for the best makeup person and the best handlers
exactly
and it 's a it 's a lot
i 've worked in public relations a lot
and uh that kind of thing can make and break make or break you
well that was certainly a media event
and it 's just uh uh
he possibly could have uh won that election had it not been for some of the the uh the way he presented himself
well he had a classic case of hoof in mouth disease
hoof is is i guess the right term for him
okay
uh go ahead
what are we supposed to discuss again
aids research is something that that i think whether our country is putting enough money into it
more money ))
and actually i 'm concerned that they 're not
i have a friend who is working with uh who works with uh travel groups
uh-huh
and one of the ones that he 's worked with was professionals who came in for an aids uh conference in uh california
uh-huh
and these were from other people from other countries
he 's a translator
uh-huh
and in talking to the people from france he said you know
he says one of the things that really concerns me is your government is not telling you enough about how it and frightening this epidemic is
and they 're letting the information out slowly about how you know how big it is
huh
which is scary you know pretty scary when so many people get it
so i guess i 'm i 'm i 'd like to see us spend more
i do n't know that spending more always gets it
yeah
i 'm i 'm ambivalent about it because um uh well it is very frightening and scary
i have no perspective on how it relates to other diseases
and uh i mean whether
you mean more money for that means less for cancer or
yes
yeah
and uh whether those diseases can
some difference could be made if you did pour more money in like diabetes research
uh-huh
uh
uh-huh
did n't uh you know
but i uh
then part of it 's lack of education
i do n't know whether whether you know where our money would be most effectively spent
well it
i i agree with you there
because i know every time that something comes into vogue all the money goes to that one
and you do n't know whether it 's still also going to the other or if it 's a limited pie
uh-huh
money from money for taking care of the infants takes money away from taking care of the elderly
or do they both get served
uh that 's a good point
and i 'm i am concerned a lot about uh i 'm concerned about uh two things
one is preventing the spread
and the other is for uh for uh treating the illness
uh-huh
and i 'm not certain
i i
again this
i 'm telling you
basically i do n't have any opinion
uh-huh
but whether or not it would be uh our money would be better spent uh teaching you know working on the drug problems and the and the sex problems uh rather than trying to cure the people that already have it
well and one of the things i 'd
and i 'm with you that i do n't know is is that really the only way it 's being transmitted or was that the easier way to tell us and we 're going to find out more
yeah
well you know
that 's that 's the part that
t- whether my dentist or
that 's the part that scares me you know
i mean beginning with this is this is just for homosexuals
well no
it 's for homosexuals and gays
well no
actually it 's
i mean you know
did they know that all along
and i heard something the other day this sounds ridiculous about mosquitoes
and you know they 've been saying oh no absolutely not
can't get it from mosquitoes
and uh and now they are saying well maybe in the right conditions
yes
oh
and i do n't know that 's true or not
i mean i just heard it in passing
but so what does that
right
what does that mean for people that you work with and shake hands with and
and how is it really transmitted et cetera
yeah
which is i think what they also do n't know
i mean that 's
i think they they told us what was convenient and felt safe to say you know
uh-huh
it was nice to isolate it to one particular community that they have trouble you know they just as soon not approve of anyway
but but that isn't how it was in africa
no
in africa was the men and women and and had nothing to do with that
and it 's huge over there
so i i you know
and it 's beginning other countries
that 's what 's his point
this was an international conference where people are saying well but in my country it 's you know like this
uh-huh
and does that mean like flus and everything else there are all these different strains of it
oh
i mean i do n't know
all i 'm saying is i think it 's scarier than we know
uh or maybe they understand but
i think maybe more information should be given out about it
yeah
and uh and then the people that have it
it does seem that there are are some drugs that are there that you know they keep holding back
if you if i were dying i 'm not sure i would care
i i give me cyanide
i mean is it ))
yeah
right
i 'll take anything you know
uh-huh
i mean if i 'm dying if i know i 'm dying you can experiment on me
ri-
exactly
go ahead
and why ca n't you why ca n't the f d a say you know if these people knowingly consent to be research monkeys and well let them
exactly
let them do it
yeah
yeah
and that 's what i think they 're saying too
have you had any snow up your way
no
we haven't had any since uh oh just before christmas
and uh we had a lot before christmas
um
the ski resorts were really
and uh
but now we have we 've had fog for about forty days in a row and temperature inversion
so
but no uh no snow
um
the snows all melted off uh
well i talked to a woman who lived up in the hills uh mountains in uh utah i guess this last weekend
and she had uh quite a bit of snow on the ground her way
uh-huh
i guess there 's different parts of the state of utah that that does have some
but not
usually we have up to a hundred and fifty inches up at the ski resorts
and they 're down between thirty-eight and uh forty inches
um
at this time of the year
and we 've been in a drought for the last five years
and this is the sixth year
and it 's getting quite serious as far as water next summer
yeah
well the weather uh here is always a topic of conversation in texas
right
but uh we have wide variations and have warm weather when most people have cold weather
but we have our share of cold weather as well
the uh temperature this morning was right at freezing
it did n't stay there
but it was right at
oh that 's that 's different isn't it
um
we usually have some of our coldest weather toward the uh end of january
but this year it wasn't bad at all
i guess that 's because we had so much rain
i know my son was telling me about the rain down there
he said it was just
and we read in the newspaper southern part of texas i flooded out
oh yeah
and uh
well my uh my sister lives in houston
and they uh the river there was uh in the flooding stage near where her son lives
and that uh caused some uh concern of course
oh boy
they have a uh lake cabin
and uh their dock was completely under water on the lake
oh my gosh
so we really had a lot of rain
yeah my son in plano he lives fairly close to
there 's quite a wash that goes down uh through plano
right
and uh there 's walking trails on both sides a walking path
and uh when i 've gone down to visit him i 've gone on that
but uh that was clear full and up to up to some of the streets i guess
it just
yeah
we had a lot of flash floods in the area
we had a few people who ran into uh water and a few fatalities uh just a few
uh-huh
not more than ten
but
that 's funny that uh we ca n't have it in moderation instead of having either a drought or having too much
well the uh there 's an old profane expression about texas weather
it 's always too damn cold too damn hot too damn windy
yeah
well it 's uh interesting
uh
i 'm going down to el paso next week
and uh i was wondering what the weather was
but i imagine if it 's that cold in dallas it
well el paso wo n't be cold
it 's not a does n't get that cold i guess huh
no
it 's it 's quite southern
and it 's it 's rare to get real cold in in el paso
uh-huh
the uh you 'll be flying in there
yes
well uh take off is uh fun from el paso because you normally
the way the winds are you take off right toward the mountain the rockies
yes
and they 're towering above you
and so you circle back over the air and then make a circle around and come back over again
yeah
we 're kind of used to that here in utah
course there are mountains
and i fly into montana a lot
and we have a
the mountains are are really uh high
and a lot of places we go in to you just kind of uh
it 's in the little valley
but i uh sure hope we
we really need the moisture
i hope we can get uh get some
there 's supposed to be a storm
but it split went down through uh northern arizona and southern utah
and they 're not predicting any for the next uh week anyway up here
so
well i noticed on the weather map on uh cable network that there was supposed to be a storm front moving into california and on down your way
but i guess it did n't pan out huh
yeah
well that 's that 's what the
above uh
some of it went to the south and some to the north up into montana
so that just left us
we got a high pressure system which been sitting in the
huh
and uh we broke the record for the amount of fog that we 've had uh you know
oh boy
airport 's been shut down uh till about noon every day
and then they seed the clouds or seed the fog to try to to get the airplanes in and out
uh-huh
huh
well we uh had a bad siege last uh christmas a year ago
we went up to visit my wife 's uh sister who lives in uh calgary alberta can
okay
all right
that 's a real different topic
i 'm not sure i 'm familiar with with what they mean of invasion of privacy
i know
i guess that i guess you consider just things that every day that would you would think of about
see i 'm a college student
so i can think of lots of things that my roommate does that bother me you know that i think 's like is an invasion of my privacy stuff like that
yeah
but i think it 'd be it is kind of a tough topic
yeah
i think personally you know
i 'm i used to be a college student ten years ago
uh-huh
uh-huh
but uh now i think an invasion of my privacy is when someone calls me on the telephone and says mrs miller have we got a deal for you
uh-huh
oh golly
you 're like no you do n't no
it 's like how do you know my name
where did you get my phone number
and why do you think it 's a deal for me
uh-huh
i mean those people they 'll call you any time of the day or night with try to solicit
yeah
and that 's an invasion of my privacy i think
they call late
now i mean now there 's i heard that they were going to start calling on saturdays or
oh they do already
see that 's
i would be so mad
well
and i 've even had the computer generated calls on sundays too
really
uh-huh
huh
but i do know of a way to get around the computer generated calls
how
don't answer your phone hello
the computer 's geared to to start talking to you on the on the word hello
really
uh-huh
huh
i do n't know
i think like things that that
i think 's like privacy is like just like not going through my stuff like going through just like my clothes or my drawer just going through my stuff basically
oh yeah
that drives me up a wall
are you and your roommate a similar size
no
see we 're not
and uh
and she still goes through your clothes
yeah
she 'll take all my shirts and stuff
because she ca n't wear like my pants
uh-huh
but she 'll take all my shirts and my blouses and stuff
ooh
man i 'm just glad she ca n't wear my pants or my skirts or my dresses you know
oh yeah
but still she 'll just take them
and she wo n't even think about it
and then i 'll like see her that day
and she 'll be wearing my clothes
and i 'll be like you know i do n't like to borrow my clothes out you know
i really do n't
so i prefer that you just not go in and get them
uh-huh
uh-huh
because she does n't even ask me
stuff like that really
like that 's an invasion of my privacy i feel like
oh yeah
i agree
stuff like that
when you have your door closed people just walking in and stuff like that
uh-huh
i was thinking like my mom
i know this
she would think this is like an invasion of her privacy is like going through her purse like if you ever needed money and stuff
oh yeah
we always just give her her purse you know
and she 'll get it out or whatever
yeah
uh-huh
i was trying to think
i was thinking that 's the only thing i could really think of that would really be
my mom does n't even like for us to go through her cabinets
really
i mean we 're all grown
all her kids are grown
and we have our own families
uh-huh
and now if we go through her cabinets she 's like well what are you digging for
yeah
get out of my cabinets
like what are you doing
don't you have your own house to dig through
that 's great
yeah
so i guess privacy is really
and at the work place i suppose
oh well actually yes
i can say definitely privacy at the work place
uh-huh
i hate it for people to open up my drawer to my desk
see
yeah
because that was that was where i kept all my stuff
and i could tell i mean even if a pen was turned the wrong way
you could tell
you know you put your stuff where it 's
yeah
that would drive that would that
it would drive it drove me batty for a while
really
yeah
well i worked a second shift
uh-huh
and everybody else in my area worked first shift
uh-huh
and our shifts overlapped
uh-huh
so i would come in
and there would be people sitting at my desk working
and i 'm wondering you know um what is this
it 's my vitamins
i wonder what is you know yeah what is
why are they working at my desk
and can i have it back
yeah
can i have it back soon maybe
then you start missing stuff
and
oh yeah
no mommy is going to take the vitamins
i 'm sorry
i have
that 's okay
see that would that would make me really mad
because you can always tell when someone 's touched your stuff
just because
i mean i know i have everything like a certain way
and you know how it looks and everything
oh yeah
well you know how you left it the day before
uh-huh child_talking
that would bother me definitely
oh yeah
so that 's child_talking
yeah
i agree
it 's it 's pretty tough that way
and i know even like with your school books and papers
uh-huh
do you miss your papers sometimes
see
yeah
uh-huh
you know
that 's the only thing i can really think about being an invasion of privacy like something every day though
yeah
well actually i do know
and i have used it once
uh-huh
and it it really is an invasion of privacy
but in the library there 's a book that you can find out what people 's phone numbers are by where they live their street address
oh really
yeah
uh-huh
and that
i mean i 've i 've used it once
okay
okay
have you done this very long
uh well yeah
for the last uh couple of months
yeah
that 's the same with us
yeah
well what kind of car would you buy
well it 's kind of hard to say
uh because i do n't think we 're going to buy another car for about three years
we just bought uh a car uh last year and then bought one in eighty-nine
oh okay
and uh
wait a minute
we bought one in ninety
we 've got three cars of all things
uh-huh
so uh probably we 'll be in at least a midsize four door sedan
okay
what kind do you have now
uh we have a a mazda nine twenty nine and a ford crown victoria and a little two seater c r x
oh okay
uh it 's rather difficult to to project what kind of uh
we 'd look always look into uh consumer reports to see what kind of uh report or uh repair records that the various cars have
uh-huh
and then of course we look into the prices
yeah
and uh uh we 're not adverse to buying along in the summer when when the cars could get to be discounted
because we keep we 've begun to keep them uh a longer period of time
uh i traded off an eighty-two oldsmobile for the eighty-nine mazda
oh uh-huh
so uh
and did you find that you like the foreign cars better than the domestic
uh yeah
yeah
we we 've had thirty some odd cars in our married life
and uh we we 've had a good many foreign cars
uh-huh
and uh they they uh
i 've been extremely
we 've had three mazdas
we 've been extremely pleased with our mazdas
oh really
yeah
we 've always bought american made cars mostly oldsmobiles
yeah
well we we 've had uh
let 's see
we had uh we had a uh
let me think
ause we had a fifty-three
and a uh we had uh two fifty-threes which is a long thirty minute story
uh and we had a sixty-five
and then we had this eighty-two
uh-huh
so we we really ca n't complain about oldsmobiles really
yeah
we 've been real pleased with ours
i think we 've had one two three
yeah
and most
we have a cutlass we still have a cutlass supreme which is like a seventy-seven
uh-huh
then we have a cutlass sierra
and we 've had the ninety-eight
uh-huh
so
but i do n't know
we 'll we 're going to be in the market for a car probably in the next year
and the financing is always something we consider you know the four percent or when they give good financing through the the motor company
uh-huh
uh-huh
but i do n't know what we 're going to buy
i always thought i would like to try a foreign made car
but boy with all the auto workers being laid off makes me feel guilty
well
so
uh my son over in shreveport uh sold porsches audis mazdas and volkswagons for ten years
and that was one of the deciding factors in getting the mazdas
oh
uh so uh the first foreign car that we had was a a seventy-seven m g m g b
oh the
was british racing green with real wire wheels and a hard top and a soft top
ooh boy
and uh i drove it mostly
i 'll bet it was hard to part with that
and
yeah
it really was
my husband was in the air force
and we got transferred to okinawa
oh
so uh we had to sell it
which really tore me up
oh yeah
because uh it it it was great fun
and then uh when we got to okinawa well we bought a second hand
we uh we decided that uh
we had this uh sixty-five oldsmobile
and it and it was just too big
so we we sold it to a fellow who was coming back to the states
and we got a little fiat uh and a and the little uh forty horse power mazda four door sedan
oh
so what do you think about caring for older folks dale
well i think uh the elderly is a really neat population to care for
uh-huh
they 've got a lot of special needs
and at the same time uh the majority of them do n't want to give up the independence that they have
right
very definitely
and so you 've got a real balance to make there
uh-huh
what about you
well i 'm thinking about it more in terms of my parents that are starting to get old
they aren't really that old
but they are sort of wearing out
my mamma is a dialysis patient
uh-huh
and she is only about sixty-four
but she 's had some pretty close calls
and my daddy has to drive her to dialysis now
and so she 's phasing out ounds like
and but she 's also a very very very independent person and does n't like having having people uh not being able to do things for herself when she wants to
uh-huh
uh i know they certainly do n't want to be in a nursing home
but my daddy keeps talking about it
i do n't
i could n't possibly could n't never see him in a nursing home
ery faint
and my grand daddy also does n't like would n't want to be in a nursing home
he 's ninety i think right on ninety right now
oh really
and he 's living by himself
my grand mamma died a couple of years ago
oh okay
so but he 's you know
as long as you can have the families take care of the people i 'd like to see them stay at home
yeah
but it gets hard
my my grandmother is in her mid eighties
uh-huh
and she 's uh suffering from uh well uh progressive alzheimer 's disease
uh-huh
so she does n't remember anybody
right
and uh she remembers things
but they are things back whenever she was real young
right
and so with
she was living by herself
but my uh uncle has moved in with her to take care of her
uh-huh
and it 's creating a lot of problems
right
especially for your uncle i bet
oh yes
yes
now a friend of mine who was studying social work here in philadelphia worked for an adult day care program for mostly for patient 's with alzheimer
do they have anything like that in dallas
in dallas
uh yeah
i 've i 've heard of several things
and they are really neat programs to be able to do if you can link up with them
but sometimes it 's hard to either find the connections to get them in or uh to be able to get them there for the day program and pick them up
right
so they are pretty limited
right
oh another interesting thing
another good friend of mine who got her degree in social gerontology well had a job for a while where she went around to to folks and had them sort of kicked them in the pants to make them take good care of their older relatives to make sure that they would take care of their responsibilities
oh really
uh-huh
i do n't think that was mainly with alzheimer 's patients but just patients people in general who were not as independent as they use to be
uh-huh
uh-huh
well it it 's it 's a really day care programs are really neat you know
and if the if the people are able and and can get up and move and everything like that that is one of the best things to do
but i think the hardest thing to do is whenever you 've got a person who 's mentally very alert and active and their body just hasn't kept up with them
uh-huh ery faint
right
and i think that 's in a way it 's more some an area where some of the day care uh programs have left off
uh-huh
because you really kind of have to be a little bit mobile to be able to do those
right
to uh get there and to participate in the activities
right
cause i know there 's one not too far from from me here in dallas
uh and they have ceramics and pottery and needle work and sports
right
right
but if your vision is gone and you have arthritis real badly
that 's true
you ca n't play those things
yeah
you ca n't do it
but you can sing songs and uh and tell stories about the old times
well that 's true
i guess you know you were talking about your
was it your grand mother that was having alzheimer uh being able to tell old stories
uh-huh
uh-huh
you can perhaps get a group of people that aren't too far along with alzheimer talking about the old times and enjoying it themselves that way
and they love to recollect
i mean they just you know
and they will just go on and on with these stories
and they have such a memory
do they like to listen to other people recollect though
my grandmother does n't
she she wants to to tell you about her story over again
so
right
which is fine you know
so
well that is good because we
um so what do you think
um
i lived i lived in sweden for two years
uh-huh
and in sweden they have socialized medicine
and so i saw some of the good
and also i saw some of the bad that results from such a program
uh-huh
uh some of the some of the good obviously that nobody has to worry about health care
right
so it 's a very it 's a very uh comfortable
i mean our people are very comfortable in the sense that you know there 's no medical emergency that 's going to make you destitute for life
right
um the bad was more apparent i think at least for me
because i think it affected people 's lives on in a way that you could see
one one thing that i noticed is it 's very very convenient to be alcoholic in sweden
oh really
because it 's treated as a disease
now i do n't know if that necessarily has to be part of socialized medicine
but uh if you 're if you 're alcoholic then you 're treated as if you 're on disability long-term disability
and so there was very little incentive for people to get out of that
huh
also um another thing that that i noticed that was very strange
i was uh i would go down all these uh uh
i remember this one row of houses
and they were uh row houses or townhouses all connected together so it was like lower middle-class housing
uh-huh
well it would be lower middle-class housing here
it 's probably middle-class housing there
uh-huh
um and there was a taxi driver that lived in one of these
and there was a doctor that lived in one of these
the one guy was a doctor
and one was a taxi driver
and so their their incomes were about the same
huh
whereas here there is a great incentive to be a doctor because there 's a great financial reward
right
and that that did n't exist in sweden
right
and uh overall i their their health care suffered fair amount from just the fact that the doctor salaries were lower
and it was it was less professional
and it was treated more like a like a taxi driver type job then a then a doctor type job
yeah
that is uh that is something i 've heard
uh i had a friend uh that i worked with that was from sweden
and that was uh
probably the the major concern i have is that you know we are leading in the technology realm of of medicine just because it is such a great incentive to to get into uh the medical field
but at the same time it 's real hard
i mean my husband works for a company that provides insurance
and so you know i 'm real you know
it 's like well you know you know
there 's got to be better ways you know to do some things
but you know i hate to uh
the the competition in a lot of ways is is wonderful just because you can choose your doctor
and and uh they have to compete to be to be good and to be knowledgeable
but at the same time there 's a you know they 're regulating themselves
and and the hospitals are charging just enormous amounts for products that they do n't have to pay very much for
my i have a brother who 's a vet
and for something that he can get you know wholesale
and i 'm sure they can get a lot cheaper because they they hospitals buy in such a bulk rate um
right
you know they could charge you twenty dollars for a dollar fifty item
and that 's ridiculous
and i do n't think that is that is uh abnormal in any means to be doing things like that
and
you do n't think it 's abnormal
i do n't think it 's abnormal for hospitals to be doing that at all
oh i see
you 're not saying it 's right
you 're just saying it 's common
yeah
and so it 's i think to me i think uh something that 's going to help our medical uh arena is for um
and i do n't know how to i do n't know how to do this
but i think people are too lawsuit happy
and i mean things will happen
and and you 've got to uh keep up
or you 've got to realize that you know it is just men or women that are that are making um decisions
and they will make mistakes
and you know if people you know
there are some people that i 'm sure make mistakes because they just do n't keep on top of it
but there are other things that just happen that you ca n't you know you ca n't say you know well if you had just done this you know things would have done differently
and um i do n't know
i i think the fact that malpractice has gone up i think has raised our prices just dramatically um in the in the last number of years
yes
and i think that 's something that if if they could work on the cause of that and
it 's uh
i 'll start off here
uh i do n't know
i get probably most of my information either from the newspaper or from c n n
uh i like c n n because it uh you know repeats it
well headline news repeats every half hour
but it makes it really convenient cause i keep a rather hectic schedule
right
yeah
and uh
but the newspaper provides a little bit of depth that you ca n't really get from
yeah
i i think i 'd agree
a a similar method of getting the news with me too
it 's uh uh c n n has been a welcome addition to the t v scene here in the last uh number of years
uh prior to cable you know you did n't get much news off of normal uh television broadcasts
right
uh just usually pretty local in in nature
and and i like uh c n n because you get some world world events too uh which is not too common on on the other format newspapers and so forth
uh-huh
right
yeah
i know the
my only major objection is that uh i do n't think american media spends enough uh attention on on our closest neighbors like mexico and canada
uh
that that 's true you know
you hardly ever see uh headline articles about the uh either the economics or or other news events going on in either of those countries
uh-huh
yeah
uh whereas if you pick up a a european paper you know uh it all the surrounding countries soviet union and everything has uh major news uh articles in them
right
yeah
i mean you know canada has gone through a lot of problems now with with quebec and and everything
and uh it 's amazing that
you know i i listen to d c area and the washington post you know
i mean the most they 'll give it is the back of the a section
yeah
uh you know
i 'm i 'm currently living in dallas
and it it wo n't even give it the back section <laughter>
you just never see you just never see anything about it
uh which is a shame because you go to other countries uh
and and they carry quite a bit about the u s on the other hand
and if you go up to uh canada those people are usually pretty uh familiar with the politics going on and and the news u s
uh-huh
and we 're pretty uh limited in our understanding of of leaders up in canada or mexico
yeah
definitely
you just do n't know what 's going on
yeah
i 'd i
every once in awhile i have to travel overseas
and lately i 've taken the taken a little shortwave radio uh around and picking up the b b c
and it 's sort of like uh a c n n too
you you can tune into some stations
uh-huh
and you get some like thirty minute summaries of of news events
uh i occasionally get into some of the middle eastern uh area
and that 's the only way you can tell what 's going on at all <laughter>
there 's not much in the way of television in some of those places
right
uh but that 's a good point about about the neighboring countries
i hadn't really thought about it
but i guess you do n't think about it cause you do n't hear it
right
exactly
yeah
i uh spent this past summer up in canada
uh well part of it touring
and uh you know i was amazed cause i 'd pick up a local paper and i 'd read about all of these you know really interesting things going on
there 's some serious talk about whether there 's actually going to be a a canada you know in the next five years you know because of the problems with quebec
yeah
and i had never heard any of that before
yeah
you know there was a a
what is it called
is it meech lake accord
uh-huh
or or that 's just something uh i 'd say ninety percent of the people here would never have heard of
and i think that i heard of it about the first time when i was up in calgary a couple of years ago and you know picked up a a paper and started reading a little bit more detail about it
and and came
it was a big thing going on there
and i came back here
and nothing in the papers
right
right
i did n't see a thing about it
so it 's uh we 've got a long ways to go i guess
it 's improved
and like i say with c n n and and uh the cable news
even even there 's uh uh
it 's it 's semireligious in some respects
but what is it
it 's uh i mean it 's news is not not that way
uh oh i 'm trying to think of the channel
the the christian science monitor
oh yeah
uh i it surprised me
i 've caught it a few times
and they they do some pretty good news
uh seemingly unbiased news broadcasts
uh uh the the title of the network is sort of surprising
uh-huh
you 'd think it would carry mostly religious
but it it does n't seem to
so i 'll flip through and listen to it once in awhile too uh and catch something maybe a little different than than c n n might be covering
uh some more interest type topics in in other countries
but it 's kind of world world uh network too
yeah
uh i i guess i 've never seen the t v show
i used to get the uh
a uh golden retriever
ooh that 's one of my favorite kinds of dogs
yeah
is it really
how long have you had it
we 've had him for
let 's see he just had his fourth birthday
fourth birthday
yeah
and we got him when he was about eight weeks old
and uh he 's pretty okay
we like him
does he shed a lot
he does
that 's the one thing we do n't like about him
in fact we threaten him in the summertime that we might just shave all of his hair off
he 'd probably look pretty funny if we did that
how much does he weigh now
he actually he just went to the vet yesterday to get his shots and everything
and they put him on the scale
and he 's up to ninety four now
oh
but he 's not a real he 's not a real tall uh dog for a golden retriever
he 's kind of stocky shorter and stockier
um
but
is he good with family
he is
it 's uh just me and my wife
and uh he 's kind of our temporary substitute for having kids
we treat him like our kid right now so he 's spoiled rotten
yeah
i can understand that
because i
get away with that a little bit more with pets than you can with kids
uh-huh
how about you
well we have a cat who 's also about four years old
oh
and he 's our spoiled child right now too
uh-huh
and he also sheds a lot
yeah
but we uh we hope to get a golden retriever someday
but we figure we 'll get the kids and then the the dog
that 's probably a good idea
they 're good though
uh have you ever had a retriever before
no
but my husband had one when he was growing up
because i i find that they 're good around other animals like cats and other dogs
they do n't tend to get real jealous or territorial
they like to play
um
especially with the kids
they love to play with kids
is is your dog an inside and outdoors
no
he 's pretty much an inside dog
um
he stays in
we we 're kind of in a not a real busy neighborhood but more so than i 'd want him to be out too much
and he does n't like it if we tie him outside
oh really
he 's really a wimp
and when it comes to being alone
uh now if you give him the freedom to walk around and go wherever he wants he likes that
but he does not like to be tied outside
he 'll he 'll just bark and bark and bark
um when he gets outside does in does he run away and then eventually come back
no
he 's uh taken to the training pretty well
and uh he knows where our yard is
and we have a pretty small yard
but he seems to know the boundaries
um
and he usually is good about staying within them
although our next door neighbors have a dog too
and uh she she is good friends with my dog
oh yeah
and so he often gets to smelling her scent and will go over there to sniff around and stuff
but he 's pretty good
he stays out of the street
and uh if i catch him i call him
and he comes back
so he he 's pretty good about taking to commands and and things
um
did you bring him to a doggy obedience school or just train him on your own
no
we never did
and
i i trained him on my own
and uh this is the first dog i 've had all my own as an adult
uh-huh
we 've had kid or we 've had dogs when i was a kid
but this this is the first one that i uh took in
so i wasn't sure if i 'd be able to get it all right the first time
but uh he he seems to have picked it up pretty well
i never really to hit him or anything
uh-huh
just you know firm tone of voice and those sorts of things
huh
really
i i see other people out there
and they hit their dogs and try to
and and those horrible collars that they put on them with invisible fencing
least i
invisible what
invisible fencing
have you heard of that
no
what is that
it 's uh it 's a system you can put in your yard where you bury these little uh transducers or emitters in your yard at the perimeter
oh
and then they wear a collar with a special little attachment on it
and if they get too close to that perimeter it it zaps them
oh
boy
yeah
i 'd be afraid to walk around if i was that dog
yeah
well a friend of mine at work here said that he tried it with his dog
and he wanted to see what he was subjecting his dog to
so he held on to the collar
and he walked out to the perimeter
he said it was a good jolt
oh really
yeah
and so i i do n't take too well to to those sorts of training techniques
um
i do n't think they 're always necessary
if you put enough patience into
yeah
just be consistent and diligent with it
uh-huh
and um
it 's uh is your cat an indoor cat or an outdoor cat
yeah
he 's indoor and all declawed because i know the uh average life span of an outdoor cat is eighteen months
somebody just told me that
yeah
because of the leukemia
yeah
that and also just uh getting hit i guess or getting beat up
and the average life span of an indoor cat is eighteen years
wow
so
quite a difference
yeah
what uh what kind of climate do you have
well uh it 's we just moved recently
so now we 're in the uh dallas area
and it 's very very nice
oh
and
the only experience i have
i do n't have any children
but i 've uh i was a baby-sitter in high school
and then just recently after we were married i baby-sat for a dentist while she worked
and i just uh
<talking> yeah
that 's the only thing i 've ever done also is baby-sit
is it ery faint
but uh i 've heard people that i work with talk about you know child care
especially i guess it 's even harder on single mothers
oh yeah
the expense
yeah
having to pick up the kid by you know six o'clock
or it 's five dollars for every minute you 're late and stuff like that
uh-huh
which is understandable
i mean these people ca n't you know stay there till eight o'clock because somebody has to work late
just sit around
that that 's true
but
see the lady i did it for
that 's why she picked me is because i would go to her house so she would n't have to get her little girl up
so she could sleep in
and uh then she could be at home
and then i 'd bring her to my house for a couple of hours if i wanted too or whatever
but uh she paid i think it was two or i think it was about two fifty three dollars a hour
and by the time i paid taxes on it it i was getting like eighty cents
and that wasn't counting food or gas or anything
oh no
yeah
it 's hardly worth your time
yeah
yeah
that 's pretty bad
the only time i baby-sat was in high school
and it you know
of course you do n't
i did n't pay taxes on that
so
right
it was easy you know go over to some uh
it was these people that lived in our neighborhood
and i 'd just go over there
every thursday night they went to the theater
they had permanent tickets
and they 'd give me
it was supposed to be two dollars an hour for two kids
but they would usually give me like five dollars more at the end of the night
oh wow
and i mean they 'd you know
it was great
i 'd go over there
and there would be like uh you know there 's we have these videos over here
watch whatever you want
and there 's some oreos in the in the cupboard
and there 's some coke
and you know just help yourself to anything
so it was it was you know the best
wow
that was a long time ago
and that was only for a few years
just once a week
yeah
but i do n't know
i think people that treat their baby-sitters like that get a lot better baby-sitters
oh yeah
that 's true
and they stick around for longer
because i mean after i figured out i was getting eighty cents an hour i said bag it
and i quit you know
yeah
i was just like but i 'm wasting my time
yeah
i really liked the little girl and everything
but i thought
she does take up
and they do take up a lot of your time
that
yeah
yeah
i
they 're very demanding
uh-huh
well and she was really spoiled
they did n't make her eat anything she did n't want or anything
so basically they fed her cookies for breakfast and lunch
and the mom was a dentist
and i was just like we 've got to quit this
and she 's like no i do n't want her to starve
but i do n't want to make her eat something she does n't want to eat
oh shoot
my mom would be like uh eat it or do n't eat anything
eat this or <laughter>
that 's right
so i can see the concerns on what different people want
yeah
because some
i mean you know if i was setting up a daycare there would be so many needs you would have to customize your service to
yeah
uh-huh
cause some parents wo n't put up anything where others would
i think
yeah
i think the best way to go would just be to to be able to do it out of your basement
uh-huh
and just have like at the most like ten kids
and all from maybe people that you know type of thing
no
instead of trying actually to set up a daycare where you do n't know the people coming in and
that 's true
i i 'd love to do it
but i just do n't trust people now
there 's too many lawsuits
yeah
i just i think it 's a bigger risk than
more than what it 's worth
yeah
yeah
it would scare me
with
i do n't know
cause i 'm sure some of them have good reason to sue
but i think a lot of them are just you know they 're negligent
and they get happy about money
and they just want to sue you
yeah
well yeah
that 's
yeah
exactly
when you have like a kindercare or something set up and when they get greedy or whatever that 's when they have maybe one assistant to twenty kids or something
uh-huh
oh yeah
and that 's just you know
you ca n't watch that many little kids getting into things at one time
that 's impossible
you know you never know what they 're going to get into
i have a girlfriend that works at a daycare
and she takes her little girl with her
and i mean she told me about half the people that they hire
and half of them she 'd like to turn them into the state
and that 's the people that are working there you know
and then she would like to turn in half of the parents that drop their kids off because of the condition the kids are in you know
oh that 's horrible
like they 'll be in the same clothes they were the day before the same diaper
huh
you know just awful things
and so i do n't know
i do n't have kids
but i always think man i just do n't know if i could trust anybody
i mean you just do n't know
yeah
that 's
yeah
that 's a hard thing about it
if i mean i i ca n't foresee myself getting married
but if you know if i ever wanted to have a kid how could i work
i mean i do n't think i could trust somebody with my kid either
unless it was a friend that you know did it in ounds like an airplane their house that i knew well
oh yeah
that 's true
yeah
i just i could n't do it i do n't think
it would just rip me apart i think
i do n't know
yeah
just not knowing
yeah
just besides the fact that you know your when your child gets out of school at three o'clock and then has to wait
what do you usually wear to
well let 's see
it turns out that uh
i work at tektronix
and it 's a very uh low key place as far as dress goes
uh-huh
you just wear uh
let 's see
when i first came here i wore suits
but after a while i got uh found out that that wasn't all that important
i 'm an engineer
oh i see
and uh so i get to wear just uh how shall i say it uh walking shoes as opposed to dress shoes and well walking how shall i say it kind of like avia uh walking shoes uh
uh-huh
well that 's nice comfortable stuff
yes
open shirt open at the neck you know no tie
wow
and uh just uh reasonable looking how shall i say it uh sports clothes or some guys wear some people even wear levis
wow
that 's nice
now being from philadelphia i do n't expect your dress code to be quite that relaxed right
well actually right now i 'm a full time college student
so my dress code is very very (( ))
oh okay
yeah
i usually wear jeans and stuff to classes or shorts in the summertime
but over the summers i 've had a job internships with the newspaper
uh-huh
and that 's so
generally then i dress you know nicer
usually nice summer slacks or more sometimes skirts stuff like that
so then it 's still you know the emphasis is on comfort a lot because it 's a lot of walking and coming out of office
but you still have to have a professional imagine kind of thing to go out to meet people and interview people and stuff like that
yes
so
yeah
well i uh i just recently applied for a different job in the company here
and so i decided well i 'd wear a suit
oh really
uh-huh
and it it was very interesting
uh like i said most of the people at at this company do n't wear suits
uh most of the engineers and technical people are just very casual almost the same clothes that that you 'd wear to school
wow
that must be nice atmosphere then
well it has been
although the new president and c e o of the company is from a much more formal eastern uh background
oh
and so the result is that uh
so anyway i wore this suit
and i went over to uh uh to one of the buildings that has a lot more of the financial people in it
uh-huh
and it and i i was almost converted because uh the effect of that suit on the way people reacted and responded to me as opposed to the
uh just to kind of
how shall i say it
they know you 're there
but they do n't
uh you do n't
there 's no notice at all
but when i wore a suit that day uh it was obvious that people did n't know whether i was a worker bee or a manager
wow
so people uh how shall i say it made a made much more effort to notice you acknowledge your presence say hello and uh things like that
so
that 's interesting
it 's like a mini little study there
yeah
that 's really interesting
and so this dress for success thing i think is uh
by and large i 've i 'm kind of uh convinced that uh by that just that one uh uh experience and then having talked to several other people that that uh unless you 're in a an environment where they 're going to make fun of of of better clothes that better clothes always pay off
right
huh
that 's interesting
doesn't mean they have to be uh
how shall i say it
they do n't have to be the the most uh the absolute best
uh-huh
but uh a little dressing a little bit above the standard i think would uh pay off
so i 'm in the process of telling my wife we got to go shopping for clothes again
<laughter> that 's neat
that 's neat
and uh i i do n't know
now i i know eastern
now the other thing we do here of course is a single not quite a single climate
we have uh we do have some snow in the wintertime
and it can be quite warm in the summertime
uh-huh
not hot like uh
i lived in the midwest for a while
oh
and i know that uh you know it can be freezing cold in the wintertime and hot and uh sticky in the summertime
uh-huh
we do n't have that much
it 's uh it 's a very mild climate
oh well that 's nice
that 's good for the clothes budget i would imagine
yes
it is
because here gosh we had uh
the winter hasn't been bad this winter
it 's it it 's only snowed maybe once or twice
but it 's been cold
low twenties let 's say
and then the summer gets up to eighties nineties
so
you interested in woodworking
yeah
actually i uh i guess i am
um it just seems kind of funny that this is a topic of discussion
uh i do uh some uh woodworking myself
uh in fact i 'm in the middle of a project right now making a bed for my son
um what kind of
it 's uh it 's uh it 's uh plywood uh face i guess
pine
but i cut it out in the shape of a crayon box
and then i painted uh about eight different uh colors uh you know
the crayons that are sticking up it will be the headboard
uh-huh
i guess he 's young
and then
yes
he 's about five and a half years old
oh he 'll be delighted
oh yeah
uh-huh
now i just have to finish it though
i got uh it got delayed for a little bit and uh because of work
and now uh i 've got to jump back in and finish the
because i 've got it all cut out
it 's all uh
i 've done most of the coloring
but i 've got to go a second layer with the yellow
did you do it with a jigsaw
or do you have powered you know a
uh yeah
uh i did uh jigsaw uh and the uh regular straight saw for some of it
um
so yeah
to do the uh the turn cut
uh how about yourself
well i 'm i am interested in woodworking
i do n't have lots of tools
our local schools have adult education in the evening
oh
uh and i use their tools and some of their guidance
i 'm an artist
oh okay
and i 'm very handy
and you know if i touch it it turns into something <laughter> us- usually
that 's great
what what type of art do you focus on
i have a master 's degree
and and my projects had to do with acrylic painting
but i 'm really interested in the crafts
huh
i make stain glass
i 've done some silver jewelry making
and i kind of
once i get you know really pretty good at something i want to try something else
yeah
kind of jack of all trades master of none
yeah
well no
actually i get good enough to sell it or have people say oh wow
you did n't buy it
you made it
that 's great
and then i it 's like well the thrill is gone
so let 's do something else
right
you want to uh explore a new field
or or
well yeah
i i 'm signed up for a class in pottery making because i 've never tried that yet
huh so you have a m f a in in what division of art
but
well i i actually have a masters of art
and it 's in art education
oh okay
so i 'm a licensed teacher
but jobs being what they are i substitute teach
yeah
and that way i have time for my kids too
and i 've been fortunate that i can afford to work part-time
i do n't know how long that 's going to last
oh yeah
and uh they 're cutting back
so i do n't go in all that often
but i 've been real interested in some of those cute country country kind of things
uh i see stuff in craft galleries for five hundred dollars
and i say oh no
and and i go
and i make it
yeah
that 's how i started jewelry making
i i love to cook
oh that 's great
and i saw a silver necklace that had these little teeny weeny silver spatulas and and and knife and and a fork and all kinds of stuff
and i went
and i signed up for class because then again you get you know get someone to guide you
and you get the tools you do n't feel like buying
exactly
and i made a necklace that i saw in a gallery for three hundred twenty dollars
it took me a lot of time
but it did n't
oh yeah
but if it cost me twenty dollars you know
and then i
and your time
then you 're that much farther ahead
yeah
then i saw a one of these country looking wood watermelons
it was a solid watermelon with a wedge cut out of it
right
i 've seen them
and then the watermelon the red with the with the seeds painted in
and
oh yeah
uh-huh
that 's neat
i went there
we have home depot out here
i do n't know if you 've heard of it
i went
and i got two six foot inch thick boards turned into a watermelon
yes
we have one
i had to cut into slabs and build up this big square and turn it on the lath
and cutting that wedge out was no joke
huh
oh i 'm i 'm sure
we did it on a i had a uh i did it through adult ed again
a band saw
what
i did it through adult ed again
uh-huh
and the teacher was one of these negative people
oh that 's dangerous
we ca n't do that
we just ca n't do that
and i 'm going well how about this way
i i want to do that
that was the plan here
right
so we did get the wedge cut out by building some kind of a cradle for it
a cradle for it
yeah
so you can steady it
and then you used a handsaw or a backsaw
well it the instructions in the book i had said use a coping saw
but there 's no coping saw big enough to for a fourteen inch wide watermelon <laughter> that
right
right
and he wanted me to do it by hand with a regular saw
i said i 'm not that steady
it 's not going to happen
yeah
so we built a cradle for it
and we got once it was turned we got one one cut out on the table saw on the radial saw
by getting the other one out without the slice now flying in your face was something you had to think about
right
so
now did you cut a quarter wedge in this
uh i 'd say it 's about an eighth
you know
well i i 'm envisioning uh uh a a watermelon like a log
and then uh what i 've seen of this kind before is you have the uh the uh
it 's uh
if you 're looking at adding on you have
up here in rochester uh we 're the second cleanest metropolitan city as far as air pollution
i think grand rapids was number one
uh we really do n't have too much of a problem as far as uh industry since we 're pretty technologically based as far as our industry in the city here
but we do have the same problem a lot of other areas up here in the northeast have
and that is the effects of acid rain coming basically from coal plants in ohio and illinois and indiana
right
well that 's true
actually down here we do n't have a big problem with uh with air pollution
mainly because we do n't have anybody to to either side of us
uh which helps out a lot as far as that goes
i would n't even necessarily thought of that except when i lived up in boston and up in uh you know
debates would come up up there in massachusetts and you know in that area over uh air pollution
and their attitude 's basically well prevailing ins winds are to the east
so why should we have to worry
yeah
i 've i 've uh was in los angeles once
and that was quite a difference as far as pollution goes
i mean you could n't really see that much
every once in a while we have these air inversions the weather inversions
oh yes
nothing
and then it gets hazy around here
but they 're really
we do n't have a big problem with it
i think that uh what most of the people here in new york state are going after right now is
it 's it 's the uh ongoing acid rain problem
especially out in the uh uh adirondack areas where you know the lakes are becoming uh changing the acidity of the lakes
and we 're having problems now because the fish are dying and certain acidic loving plants uh or alkaline liking plants are not lasting anymore because the soil levels the p h is changing as this acid rain continues to fall
right
and i know that there 's been battles over the states up here
uh you know governor mario going after you know governors of ohio and and indiana to fix what 's going on down there
i remember when i was in florida
the only problem was that it seemed like it may
it wasn't really pollution just the steamy weather <laughter>
oh absolutely
yeah
just muggy
so yes
i think
yeah
i think you 're right
our most pollute substance down here is just water
but i i i i think you know the biggest causes even then a lot of times are uh uh like when i was up in boston just all the cars you know just all over the place
yeah
it
you just got a lot of you know a lot of pollution from those
and uh you know if you do n't have a wind it sticks around
oh yeah
i you know i was in boston once
and i remembered seeing some of these things coming through at rush hour even with the tee
uh just this it looked like billions of cars massing
absolutely
and if they sit there and then there 's nowhere for the air to go
i mean yeah that 's what 's in you know los angeles is
i think that 's biggest problem
because when i was in los angeles for a time it 's all you know from los angeles to san diego it 's like all city
right
and there 's really there 's nowhere for this to be absorbed really
uh tree planting sometimes can handle you know stopping some of the air pollution and that and help
but if you have nowhere to do anything
that 's that 's very true
uh you know of course then when when you 're not recycling you 've got these incendiary plants and stuff that can give you some pretty disgusting stuff going up in the atmosphere
but i you know you 've got you 've got the industry
you 've got that
and you got the cars
i think the cars are where where it 's at right now as far as pollution goes air pollution i mean
yeah
i you know florida does n't seem to be at least maybe miami
but i i uh you know
fort lauderdale i i do n't know what the big industries are down there uh
but you know up here we have kodak
right
and that 's the worst polluter
they put uh uh
you can smell ether in the air sometimes
it keeps the neighborhoods happy i guess
i guess so
uh cause they clean the uh the lenses for cameras
and they they make film here
and they 're the worst offender
but it 's you know it 's under so much control
you know sulphur dioxide is the big emittant from them
but that 's really getting under control now
right
i you know i do n't know in air what they do
uh i i haven't run across any major pollutants down there that i 've i 've really seen a lot of you know about
uh i i know i 've seen like uh
my grandparents live in corpus christi texas
and i know they 've there 's a lot of refineries down there
and that that 's some pretty potent stuff they put up in the air
i but i do n't know how uh you know
there 's a difference in what you can smell and what you uh you know what 's bad
be interesting to see when as mexico develops industrially whether you know without
