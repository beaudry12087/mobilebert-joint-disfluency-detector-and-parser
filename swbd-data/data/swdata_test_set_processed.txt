okay uh
could you tell me what you think contributes most to uh air pollution
well it 's hard to say
i mean while it 's certainly the case that things like automobiles and factories uh pollute a lot uh if you look at how much pollution is say kicked up by an active volcano uh it 's certainly less than clear that anything man can do in this sort of scale of things has much effect at all
what do you think
um well you talked about uh volcanos
i 'm not sure how many active volcanos there are now and and what the amount of material that they do uh put into the atmosphere
i think probably the greatest cause is uh vehicles especially around cities
uh-huh
um uh do you live right in the city itself
no
i 'm more out in the suburbs
but i certainly work near a city
okay
so can you notice
how about you
well it 's it 's
i live in a rural area
uh-huh
it 's mainly farms and uh no heavy industry
attleboro itself
i live in rhode island
oh i see
and it 's in the north
i live up in the uh northeast corner
and attleboro sits in just over the line where t i 's plant is
uh-huh
but there isn't a lot of heavy industry
there 's the freeways
and we get an occasional
it depends which way the wind 's blowing from boston cause we 're like forty miles south of boston
so we 'll pick up that
and uh i 've noticed over the past say maybe five or six years uh
we live about twenty miles away from the state airport
and i notice that the fly patterns now of the jets are getting bigger
they 're swinging wider so that now they are coming over over our homes
uh-huh
and it seems like uh we 're catching all that residue
i 'm not sure if it 's kerosene or what that 's dropping
but other than that you know we do n't have the unless we 're catching it from the midwest the emissions you know from the power plants um
yeah
you mean like from the coal
yeah
yeah
we generate
one of our our biggest electrical plants in rhode island uses coal to uh generate electricity
um
um there does n't seem to be much emission from them
but i 'm not sure about the rest of the country
yeah
i notice locally a major problem is kodak
um it 's interesting
because in order to uh keep with the e p a standards which which tend to be visible uh what 's coming out of your smokestack they do all their emissions at night
uh so people get up
okay
well is that right
yeah
people get up in the morning in that neighborhood
and they 've got this black ash on their cars which you know seems to be
yeah
surprise surprise
yeah
i mean i really think that if the e p a had anything on the ball they 'd go in there with a few phosphorous grenades light up the sky photograph the emissions at that point and uh you know
yeah
there there must be uh uh some of the some of the uh larger plants up uh up around one hundred twenty-eight
uh-huh
um we 've got reports that uh
during the night seems like they 'd blow off their their stacks from uh the warehouses for powerhouses
right
uh-huh
and they do that at night too because employees been complaining that the cars have been pitted and you know spots all over them
right
yeah
yeah
so you 're right
they could do something about about that i guess
yeah
that seems a little ridiculous
how are your uh your lakes
and uh
oh they 've been getting cleaner
they have
sure
but um yeah
i 'm not sure how much the water pollution is is directly related to the air pollution other than acid rain
yeah
acid rain
yeah
that 's that 's what i was uh
i mean the stuff i 've read recently in technology review basically indicates that acid rain may be a little bit uh overstated that a lot of the die off they 've seen in forests may not really be due to acid rain at all
um
i 'm not an expert
yeah
no
didn't they just have an article oh on uh
they were dumping lime
up here
up upstate new york somewhere over huge areas
i haven't read that
oh yeah
and they thought that was more beneficial because you know it it some of it does soak in
and some of it runs off right away into the in to the streams and rivers
and some of the fish were supposedly making a comeback
uh-huh
i ca n't remember where
i i read that recently somewhere
and i ca n't remember where
yeah
that 's
but i i thought it was up there
so that 's interesting because new hampshire and parts of vermont um they showed pictures of of extensive tree damage that they attributed to acid rain
uh-huh
um
um you kind of think it 's something else then
well that 's what the environmentalists were claiming in this article
so that
oh they did n't say they did n't say what though
they just said they thought it was
they did n't say what
they just said they thought acid rain 's contribution may be less than was previously suspected um that it may be other natural things at work um
uh natural disease
yeah
so it 's it 's less than clear
like i said i do n't remember the article that well
yeah
yeah
but um i do n't know
i mean what do you think we can uh i guess as individuals or as a group do about uh air pollution
uh we can demand uh more efficient automobiles for one thing
i still think that 's that 's uh one of our major causes of pollutants
uh-huh
uh how we go about that it 's uh uh it 's a little bit difficult
i think it 's up to individuals too to ask automakers for for less pollutant vehicles
yeah
yeah
you i think you need a a vehicle something like uh ralph nader nader 's raiders or where uh or uh uh a a r p which has a lot of members uh if you can get those types of groups
yeah
uh-huh
do you really think that new vehicles though is a big problem
i mean i remember reading an article that said like it 's uh the older polluters
the the twelve and fifteen year old cars you know contribute like ninety percent of the automobile pollution
yeah
and the new cars it 's hardly is hardly anything
yeah
they 're better
but how about all the trucks and buses that are out there
uh when was the last time you saw a truck that did n't belch smoke or uh
yeah
but does n't that just mean they 're out of tune
uh i 'm not really sure
you think that that that the uh the trucking industry is that uh incompetent that they would n't you know
fuel is is one of their biggest costs
right
so you would
but diesel engines
yeah
diesel engines
it you know it 's it
i mean they do generate a lot of soot
but that at least that kind of particulate comes out of the air pretty quickly
yeah
yeah
we could also uh push for legislation for uh rapid transit systems
this country seems to be a little behind on that
yeah
on the other hand most people do n't use rapid transit because it 's so inconvenient
um yeah
but only because we got used to uh single person single car driving
uh-huh
a lot of people do n't even like to carpool
uh-huh
but we could that
that 'll help pollution air pollution
uh-huh
the uh united states and canada are i guess is is going into uh some types of agreements to limit uh what 's being given out by power plants
uh-huh
i guess canada 's quite concerned that we 're sending a lot of our stuff up there
yeah
sure
so that 's helping
well what do you think about like a device a meter right on a tail pipe
and you pay the tax based on how much you polluted
now that 's an idea
do n't say that too loud though because uh every city and town will have a meter on your tail pipe generating generating revenue
well it just means if you do n't pollute right or you pollute very little you do n't have to pay any tax
or you just buy one of these things
and it it uh
maybe you you could probably devise them so it slowly closed off your tail pipe
and uh the less you pollute the longer the devise lasts
and if you pollute a lot then it closed off your tail pipe
and you could n't start your car anymore
that 's a that 's an interesting concept
is that your idea
yeah
but uh you know it 's uh
i guess the difficulty would be to that somebody could obviously just take it right off the tail pipe again
so you probably would have to build it right into the muffler or something
well i was going to say
right
you could put it in you could you could it could be installed like a catalytic converter
right
i mean i guess you could take those off too
but
you could take
but mufflers would be a little more obvious if you took that off
yeah
if you can take a muffler off and only replace
well not unless it was built into every muffler
right
and that 's
but if you was talking about something which was more or less universal that uh busses and any kind of vehicle had to pay a pollution tax uh this would penalize the heavy polluters and not penalize the light polluters
that 's a that 's quite a concept
you should uh pursue that i think or patent it you know
yeah
patent it
that 's a good idea
if you could come up with a device that 's the thing
right
but it should n't be too hard to do something like that
but that 's a that 's a thought
no
uh-huh
you 're right
and that will solve uh a lot of problems
i do n't know if you uh if you approached the automobile industry if they would be too keen on installing something like that
uh-huh
uh but you know a proposal to uh uh i guess the proper authorities
uh-huh
well you might uh generate some
yeah
the automobile regulatory agencies or something
yeah
you might generate some interest in it
but that 's that 's a good idea
other than that i 'm not sure what what individuals can do other than like i said get involved through a group or an organization
uh-huh
what are your music interests
uh just about any kind of music except acid rock
i i do n't care for acid rock
me too
oh
but uh i grew up with country and western
yeah
i did too
but uh
and then
just about any kind of music
i even like classical music
yeah
uh i 'm pretty diversified too
i i do n't i do n't like acid rock either
i i grew up in a small town
so uh the only we only had one radio station
so it was country music
yeah
but then uh when i
yeah
i grew up with hank snow and lefty frizzell and hank williams and all of those old country and western songs
oh really
you 're older than i am
but uh i
did you happen to see last night the special on channel two with james galway
we do n't get channel two
my uh our cable does n't
oh
i wish we got that what
but
that is fabulous
was it
well we do n't get channel two
we
yeah
when he played danny boy it just almost brought tears to your eyes because he can make that flute sing
oh really
yeah
and uh it was tremendous
now he he is a uh
actually i did
i played flute for almost ten years
yeah
and and uh so i i i appreciate his too his his
yeah
he he he 's from ireland isn't he
yeah
uh-huh
and it was uh mostly all irish tunes
was
yeah
they had a band with him that uh had a harpist and another flute and then a guy that played the bagpipes plus the uh tin whistle and a couple of violins and uh drum
yeah
uh-huh
and they they played all the irish jigs and so forth
it was just fabulous
yeah
i he he is really good
yeah
i i i come from a musical background
yeah
so uh uh i 've played flute flute and piano
so i i i have a big appreciation for music up to a point
yeah
yeah
i i 'm getting now to the age where i do n't like the new stuff that 's coming and much of the new stuff that 's coming out
yeah
yeah
my husband says i 'm getting old
yeah
i love uh i i especially like instrumentals
do you
yeah
i love to just lay back on the couch and and turn a good good instrumental got on and just close my eyes and listen
yeah
that 's that 's nice to do that is
i 've got a i 've got a i 've got a two year old who 's now getting
i 'm getting well versed in in kiddy music
yeah
i 'm i 've never played an instrument in my life
i 've always wanted too
yeah
i 've always wished my parents had forced me to learn the piano or something
yeah
but uh
i was one of the forced ones
but i i 'd just love to be able to go to a party or something and sit down at the piano and bang out music
oh i could never do that
and
i was never that brave
but uh yeah
i guess the closest i 've ever come to participating in music is singing in the choir
yeah
oh yeah
i 've i 've done i 've done that at church too
yeah
i haven't done that in a long time
yeah
so let 's see
what
well what kind of music do you not like
well like i say the acid rock
i just do not
an i do n't care for rap music either
oh
that 's not music
uh-huh
no
that is not
i do n't know what that is
but that 's not music
if i ca n't understand the words i do n't want to listen to it
well it 's it 's it 's not it 's not music
it 's just it 's just uh uh talking in a beat
it is just it 's not exciting at all
yeah
it does n't it does n't give you relaxation
yeah
you ca n't dance to it
you ca n't do anything to it
right
but i and i love i like orchestra music too like the boston pops or or anything
yeah
yeah
have you ever been to the to to the dallas symphony
uh-huh
have you
is
are are they good
yeah
yeah
they 're good
are they
i i have i have never been
and uh we went and saw uh les miserables
oh really
oh the music in that was fantastic
i i 've heard i 've heard that that is a really
yeah
i heard that was hard to get tickets to
yeah
it it uh
i ca n't remember how far in advance we reserved tickets
but it was out you know out at the state fair music hall
and uh it was well worth the price
yeah
yeah
that was a real
was it
yeah
i i bet it was
yeah
i i really bet it was
is that the only uh musical
do you go see a lot of musicals
just just ever so often you know a real a real good one like that one
yeah
and
that that would be that would be nice
i went and saw uh i think it was uh sugar babies
that was good
that had good music in it
was it
how how
i ca n't i do n't know what that 's about
uh that was the one with mickey rooney
and uh oh what 's that real oh not real old my wife she is old too dancer uh
i ca n't think of her name
i got it right on the tip of my tongue and ca n't say it helen something
uh uh uh i think i know who you 're oh i know who you 're talking about
real long legs and dark hair
she 's got black hair
yeah
okay
i know who your talking about
i ca n't think ever her name either
i ca n't think of it
yeah
that that was that was
i remember that being uh here a few years ago
yeah
but uh
oh oh the last country music
my my parents still uh really like country music
yeah
and they they like uh they like the oak ridge boys and the statler brothers
oh yeah
yeah
and and uh well my my my my parents
the blackwoods
yeah
my husband likes uh country music real well
and he he likes some of the new groups like shenandoah
yeah
and yeah
he really likes shenandoah
alabama
yeah
yeah
well yeah
alabama
uh
i think i think they 're a bit over exposed
yeah
i get kind of get tired of every other song being alabama on the radio
yeah
either alabama or hank williams junior
oh i i 've never cared for hank williams junior
i never have either
and i never have figured out how he won uh entertainer of the year for about three or four years in a row
oh
oh we we watch those award shows too
we enjoy watching the country and the grammies and stuff
but i just i just do n't care for him
yeah
i just never have
i do n't
i guess probably my favorite all time country and western song or singer is uh probably eddy arnold
is is it
uh-huh
okay
i i think i i know who that is
uh-huh
i think my parents have have uh some of his records
but uh i got a i 've got about a hundred and or had a uh some uh i sold some of them i had about a hundred and fifty old seventy-eight r p m records of country and western songs
yeah
wow
smiley burnette i do n't know if you were old enough to remember him him
i 've heard the name
he was uh played in the old western movies
he was the sidekick of gene autry i believe
huh
or they
i think his name in in the movie was froggy
and
i 've i 've never seen a gene autry movie
had a real raspy voice
huh
and uh
no
i never have
some of those old ones of course bob wills miss texas playboys ernest tubbs and red foley an
yeah
yeah
those go back quite a way
yeah
i took them up here to collectors records and was able to get a little money for them
yeah
but uh my mother and dad use to uh own a restaurant
it 's hard to
oh yeah
and he had uh they had a uh nickelodeon of course in the restaurant
yeah
and when they would come and change the records the guys would the guy would give her the old records
well that
that 's neat
so that 's where i got my
that would be great if they weren't too worn out at the time
yeah
of course there 's not a whole lot of market for seventy-eight r p m records
is there not
you you 'd well you 'd think there would be
well the problem is most of the record players now will not play them because you have to have that needle that uh particular kind of needle
well that 's true
oh yeah
and uh they just wo n't play on a modern day uh phonograph
well that 's a shame
because i i we go to antique stores a lot
and you see seventy-eights a a lot at at the stores at record stores
yeah
you 'd think there 'd be a market for
yeah
i 'm i 'm sure you could find old players for them
but that would cost a fortune if you could find them that worked
yeah
yeah
oh
of course they you know just do n't have the quality of records nowadays either because you you get that scratchy sound
no
uh-huh
well those things were big and thick weren't they
yeah
yeah
you could kill somebody with them
yeah
warped real easy
and the ones you buy
go out and buy one now
and they 're just so thin and flimsy
yeah
and they just they 're not meant to last at all
yeah
neither are tapes
i i we buy cassette tapes
yeah
and machines will eat them
yeah
and so the best bet any these days are compact disk
those things are practically indestructible
but i i guess you know the old country and western music you
back then when i was a kid there wasn't that much t v
oh no
so that 's all you had to listen to was the radio
radio
and uh
that 's just what just what you had
plus
yeah
i think it was better back then to
there 's too much t v now
yeah
and the radio is you know more exciting really than than television
yeah
your imagination
yeah
kept
and
it just did n't vegetate your mind like television does
yeah
i remember mother and dad always turned on the grand ole opera
oh yeah
yeah
was it on the radio every week
yeah
what day what day was that on
do you can you recall
uh uh seems like it was on a friday
uh
friday or
okay
okay
well what do you think about the idea of uh kids having to do public service work for a year
do you think it 's a
well i i think it 's a pretty good idea
i think they should either do that or or afford some time to the military or or helping elderly people
yes
yes
i i you know i think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that could use some help
and i think that before we expend all our young talent overseas and and helping other countries we ought to perhaps give a little bit of our help to our own folks at home
and i 'm not sure that that 's not a bad idea
that 's true
and or the military for a year or two would n't be bad for
yeah
i think it teaches kids how to grow
how about yourself
uh i agree with you
uh uh what i 'm thinking about is back well when i was a kid and much earlier than that kids were kind of
you know the parents kind of pushed them to join like the boy scouts or girl scouts
and they did do do do a lot of public service activities
but these days they 're not uh
parents aren't encouraging their kids to do things like that
because when i was in the girl scouts we did a lot of public service things because that 's just part of of the scouting and you know
yeah
i 've i 've
that 's really great
i i really think that both the boy scouts and girl scouts is a excellent two excellent organizations
they are
but parents
you know kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old they fall out of that
yeah
they do
and they do n't follow it at all you know
there are very few scouts go on and become eagle scouts
oh no
and and i do n't know what the high rank is for the gals
but
i i uh
senior
oh
senior
okay
so there 's not uh
oh they 're just not
once they get into junior high it just not done anymore
yeah
they they lose interest
and then when they young young adults there 's even less interest there
uh-huh
they 're more for i
me
not not
yeah
grab
grab
grab
walk out
yeah
you 're absolutely right
yeah
i think it 's a really a good thing
i i like to see
of course there 's you know third world countries that can use all kind of help
yeah
but there 's a lot that can be done right here in this country too
but i think we ought to start right here at home
i 'm you know
yeah
uh i 'm not i 'm not so sure that overseas help helping overseas would be such a hot idea for for uh a lot of young people
no
it it
but since there is much that needs to be done here
i think that yeah i think that we need to really address what we 've done here
and and then perhaps even a six month tour overseas that gives them much broader outlook
uh-huh
well it 's been really good
we talked about this for a few minutes
and uh hopefully we 'll have other good topic maybe another call someday
but i i do n't really have too much more to say on this topic i guess
no
i i agree with you
it we i guess we both agree that it 's a good thing that they should do sometime
yeah
okay
well you take care
and and enjoy the day
you too
you too
thank you ma'am
bye-bye
bye-bye
do are you on a regular exercise program right now
yes
and i hate it
how about you
oh well i 'm kind of off and on
off and on
well i guess i 've been kind of off and on
i 've uh had some health problems that have led me to uh
right now i 'm kind of off
i 'd say more on than off
okay
what type of exercise do you do
uh i do walking on the treadmill
and then i do low impact aerobics
okay
i guess you do n't enjoy that very much
not not really
do you find that uh to be boring
yeah
and time consuming
i mean it 's not just the exercise that 's boring and time consuming
it 's uh you know afterwards you know
then you have to take a shower and get cleaned up you know
yeah
well i 'm trying to get back in shape for softball this spring
oh yeah
but i
do you go through this is this something that you go through every year
yeah
i haven't decided whether whether i want to play yet or not
i just bought myself a solo flex machine
i do n't know if you 've seen those advertised on t v
uh-huh
it 's one of those uh universal type machines exercise machines
but i haven't really sat down and used it match yet
so it 's collecting dust right now
yeah
a lot of things do that
i had an i had an exercise bike
i used to jog somewhat
i use to have one
and i finally got rid of sit cause i never used it
but i do use my treadmill
uh-huh
well that 's good
yeah
my parents have a treadmill
it 's
when i go visit them uh i get on that thing every now and then
yeah
it 's nice because when the weather 's bad you ca n't you do n't have any excuse
uh-huh
i just got the bicycle out today
and it was real nice outside
had to get out to do something
yeah
i ca n't ride a bike
so
i 've been sitting in here in the house all weekend with a cold
so thought i better better get outside and do something and not waist the day
oh
yeah
it 's too nice
it 's been too nice all weekend
but uh yeah
i need to start jog something again
i 've always of that to be uh really one of the best forms of exercise
but it 's terribly boring
and so i really do n't ever keep a program up consistently
have you ever had any injuries from jogging
no
i never have
well i do n't job enough i think to develop any injuries
i usually only go about a mile or two
i guess it worries me about jogging it 's that i hear that it 's very hard on your body and and that you know you can end up getting hurt worse
yeah
it 's it 's tough on the joints if you jog on concrete or on asphalt
uh-huh
suppose to be much better if you find grass uh or or dirt to jog on
yeah
that 's not quite so so easy
you have to have the right type of shoes too
that 's very important
yeah
yeah
i found that true especially from walking on toe and fronts
but
yeah
i do n't have to buy jogging shoes all to often
my do n't get very much use
well i guess my breakdown about they say about every six months
uh-huh
i usually enjoy the exercise i do
but uh like i said i 'm just not very consistent about maintaining a a program
so i 'll i 'll bicycle
i get into that for for a little while and maybe go out uh on a consistent basis every couple of days and ride a bike for awhile
but then i 'll get tired of doing that and maybe start jogging again and go out about three or four nights a week
but uh that gets old too in a very short order
yeah
i 'm i 'm hoping that this uh solo flex will uh uh change things a little bit
i really need to get on a regular type of program and use that thing on a consistent basis
yeah
well do n't let it collect dust
at least exercise while dusting it off
yeah
well
maybe if i can get interested in playing softball again this string i can uh start some type of uh regular program
yeah
that that 'll be good
i 've always found that uh when you write things down and set goals it 's a lot easier to keep uh keep something going
uh-huh
uh when i was in high school we had a choice of uh taking uh physical education courses on exercise
an uh one of those involved a six weeks session on a universal machine lifting weights and uh working out like that
oh
and that was very helpful
we kept charts of our progress and uh consistently increased the empty of resistance so you could see how much you improved over the weeks
uh-huh
i found that to be uh very helpful
are you going to do that
uh i need to
i haven't started yet
but uh it 's a thought
well that sounds like something good to do then
sounds like something i should do
yeah
nice way to start off this spring get back in shape
how often do you uh uh go out each week on your walking
well i do
i switch every other day
one day i walk
and one day i do the aerobics
okay
how far about how far do you go walking
well i 'm trying to get my tolerance now
i just had surgery um less then two months ago
and right now i 'm just a little over about a mile and a half
okay
but i 'm trying to workup to three miles
well that 's good
well they say that walking is just as good if not better then jogging
yeah
it
it takes it 's just that it takes longer to get to the same effect
sure
yeah
but
well if you keep up with a consistent pace just to uh keep the heart rating going uh
my walkman broke
yeah
so i 'm upset
and i just have to turn to stereo up real loud
yeah
but it 's a lot less stressful on the joints then jogging is
yeah
it is
and this does n't you know
my treadmill has an incline
and you know you can get a really good workout on it
um do you go to an aerobics class
or do you watch on t v
no
i i just do it on t v
okay
i have a cassette
which uh shows do you watch on t v
um it 's a it 's a
i use tapes
oh okay
okay
like a cathy smith workout
or or richard simmons
or jane fonda
okay
sweating to the oldies
right
i every now and then i 'll watch e s p n
i get cable on t v
uh-huh
and they have uh a couple of shows called basic training
and uh what is the other one called
there was one guy i use to watch on e s p n
i do n't know if he 's still on any more or not
i i do n't know if i get e s p n or not
uh-huh
but uh one you know
i use to watch one watch one on the air
but that was back
bodies in motion that 's that 's the name of the one i was thinking of with gill
that 's was
yeah
yeah
yeah
i watched that cause he was cute
yeah
he 's not bad
his assistants usually aren't either
but uh
they 're always in in hawaii some place on on the beach
yeah
yeah
but then that was back when uh you know the high impact and
yeah
well they they do low i pact stuff now
do they
are
yeah
they 're still they 're still he 's still doing it then uh
yeah
every morning
i 'll have to tune in
it 's on e s p n uh
at what time
i ca n't remember what time
it 's uh you know
i ca n't remember offhand what time
i 'll have to check it check check check it back up
yeah
and but the thing is everybody always looks so good on that show at least on
yeah
every now and then
not everybody has a picture perfect body
uh-huh
well i found that they they have just a much better program than the other shows that are on t v
i haven't watch any other ones on t v watch=watched just on some of the tapes
they 're on weekdays at eleven o'clock every day monday through friday incase you 're interested in that
okay
thanks
but uh i haven't done so much as uh watch the tape that i made
now that 's a thought
so i 'm kind of bad about that myself
well that 's thought
i haven't thought about that
well they 're going to beep us pretty soon
okay
well i sure enjoyed to you about exercise and fitness
nice talking to you too
okay
thanks
so all right
talk to you later
good night
bye
bye
uh well what would you say your opinion is on gun control
well i do n't know
i 've i 've had mixed emotions i guess when i listen to uh the radio and and watch t v about the different uh things that are happening
uh i 'm against it
but on the same token uh i went out and purchased a gun just because i wanted the right to do that
so i i have a rifle in the house
uh the ammunition is probably so old i 'm afraid to use it
but uh i bought it for target practicing and uh and also because i wanted a weapon
uh how do you feel about it
well i think uh down here in texas they do n't have a waiting period on handguns
huh
and i think they need that
uh and i do have a i have a pistol
it 's a little twenty-two
and i have a twenty-two or a twelve gauge shotgun
uh-huh
you know i do like to have my guns
uh i do n't know if i 'll ever use it you know
and like you my bullets to my little pistol 's probably uh about three years old
uh my gun hasn't been shot in a year or two
uh-huh
but uh i like to have them where handy
well up uh up in new england where i 'm from uh you had to get a permit before you could buy any ammunition
and i thought that was really good
and i think if they uh
takes two weeks for that system to process uh your request for uh not as a gun permit but uh but to buy ammunition
you have to get a permit from the police station in your local area to do that
i 've never heard of anything like that
yeah uh
that would be nice
but you know
the criminals that are going to get their guns one way or the other
i i i agree
i think you know one of the things that that that needs to happen is uh to to stop the impulse buyer from uh buying it quickly and and uh maybe putting a week 's waiting period or something on it
but if someone 's really determined to to pick up a firearm you can pick it up any place
yeah
and you can get them really cheap
i know
i i had a waiting period on my pistol because i was down in uh tennessee and uh they had a waiting period
uh-huh
and uh we bought it there
and
how long was the waiting period out there
about nine days
huh
that wasn't too too bad
no
no
because if if you 're going to go buy something uh uh of that nature i think you you 're going to have some idea as to what you 're going to do with it
you 're not going to react that quickly
in other words you know you do n't have a need to go buy a gun to go shoot it the next day
somebody wants to do that
i i at times i think they ought to have a waiting period on all firearms
yeah
i do too uh because it does n't make any difference uh uh whether it 's a pistol or a shotgun i suppose
they both do the same kind of job
a shotgun hurts worse than a pistol does
uh yeah
i suppose
i never got shot with either one
but i do n't know uh
i think you could recover from a pistol but not from a shotgun
no
a shotgun 's got too much of a spread
or at least ours does
yeah
uh it 's you know
you have a little uh thing on the bottom of on top of the barrel where you you turn it
uh-huh
you can make it either tight or as loose as loose can get
oh
and the spread changes
uh i 've got a manual single shot
and i guess it does n't have any any automatic features to it
the further away i get the the uh wider the shot gets from the target
yeah
and the closer that i get the tighter that it gets
it 's got a hell of a kick to it
yeah
my husband had a uh a police gun at one time
and i shot that thing one time
almost knocked me down
and it just a
i i forget
i think it was a three fifty-seven
i 'm not sure
do you belong to a gun club or you
he belonged to one awhile back
uh since we moved
we 've only been here in texas for about a year
uh-huh
and uh we ca n't even find a place to shoot just for target practice
no kidding
i 'd love to get used to that shotgun
we traded his pistol for that shotgun
huh well the the uh clubs that we 've got around here are kind of expensive
but uh it 's well worth it
you can go down and shoot up against a sand bag and some targets and have uh competition
uh i 've never really joined a club because i haven't got the time not because i haven't got the desire
uh there 's an annual membership fee uh that 's that 's fairly high
plus there 's an initiation fee that you have to pay because of first time uh uh member
so the whole process can cost you a hundred fifty dollars to join the club
plus you have to pay for the the ammunition in any tournaments that you would join in
yeah
well that 's what my husband
when he was in that gun club where he was doing that tell if it 's a cough or something was
it you know
he went mostly just to uh shoot at paper targets
uh-huh
uh but you know they used speed and accuracy and all that
i think that that the gun clubs serve a useful purpose
in fact i 'd like to see somehow they tie the legislation into not only when you buy a weapon you have to uh show that you 've gone to school or gone to some class to know how to handle that weapon
that 's a good
i 've never thought of that
that 's a good point
and you know it it
even after you wait your nine days if you do n't know how to handle it it 's just like putting someone in an automobile that does n't know how to drive
and you give him a license because he waited nine days
yeah
that 's
and yeah
he could he could not only uh uh shoot himself
he could he could uh mishandle a weapon leave it at home and let a child get at it
it
well we uh we was living on a navy base down in memphis
and uh this one guy decided to play uh lonesome cowboy or something
and he was twirling his gun around and shot himself in his foot
wow
he was fortunate
he could he could of hit something else
well he went tumbling down the steps along with uh shooting his foot almost off
he broke his leg and collar bone and a couple of other things i 'm sure being mister cowboy
wow
i ca n't remember what the the term was going around
it was about four or five years ago
but now i guess that would be a good idea
about uh private citizens selling a weapons
like if you wanted to sell your pistol to me
how do you feel about that
do you believe there ought to be legislation guiding the uh buyer and the seller
and or do you believe that you ought to be able to sell your system uh because you own it
uh that 's a hard one because we did that
but uh i think there ought to be some rule against it
i 'll uh you know
the person who sells the gun ought to protect themselves because if that gun 's registered to them and somebody else uses that gun in something the cops are going to come to you
yeah
isn't there a way to uh to deregister yourself after you register a gun
uh
i have no idea
i 've only had one gun
because i have
and i 've kept it you know the one gun that was in my name
yeah
is it registered
yeah
the uh the rifle that i 've got is not registered
and uh i do n't know why i never registered it
but the uh
i do n't think you have to register a shotgun
um i i think it 's it 's voluntary
the uh the
well see uh my husband has a thing
if they go to uh regulating uh all right uh banning guns private citizens
yeah
this
my kid is jumping on me
i ca n't hardly talk
my husband feels that they 'll come and collect everybody 's guns
yeah
i guess that could happen
it 's just like the uh the social security system
once they uh they gave everybody a number
and now they 're making you uh uh get one at at birth
and once they have your number they have your identification
yeah
and if you try to do anything uh like uh not identify yourself to the government they know who you are
yeah
and everything about you
and that 's true
uh i
you know they know so how much money you make a week to uh probably your uh
my kid is banging
i was seeing what they was banging on
uh i 've lost my train of thought
i 'm sorry
that 's all right
you you were talking about uh uh what the federal government knows about people
oh the
yeah
they they probably know everything from half the time what time you go to the bathroom
they probably do
no
that 's that 's a little bit extreme
but they could know anything and everything about you
and uh i 'd like to have my gun
if they go to banding banning them i 'd lose my gun
but we would n't lose our our uh shotgun
yeah
and uh we 're wanting to get a couple of more that no one knows about
uh-huh
but i do n't i do n't uh
do you find it difficult picking up uh guns that that are not registered
no
no
i do n't either
i can i can buy some uh today if i wanted to
just you know put up the money
yeah
yeah
well you can look in the uh the
we got a thing down here called a shopper
uh-huh
it 's a a it 's a it 's a bargain thing
uh you go and you know always see guns in there five to seven guns a day
yeah
it comes out every tuesday
and there 's there 's no waiting period on that
no
none whatsoever
you call
we sold a refrigerator through it
and it took us all of twelve hours
to sell the refrigerator
yeah
yeah
you know and i 'm sure it 'd be even less for somebody with a good gun
huh and i think the federal government is uh is really far away from uh uh control
i i do n't believe in uh
i 'm i should n't probably say control
i mean regulation
control is something that i would n't want the federal government to have
uh but i would like to see them have a monitoring capability so that they know who has what weapons
yeah
well i agree with you there
they do have too much control over us already
yeah
uh we could look at our paychecks and see how much control they have
unfortunately we uh we vote for the the people who spend the money
so i ca n't complain too much
yeah
i guess so
i do n't know
they 're
well i haven't heard anything about the proposal myself
but uh uh i do n't know if its their proposal or one that 's being seriously kicked around
no
i haven't either
i 've i 've always felt for a long time that i i think that all young kids ought to do a stint uh primarily in the military
yeah
uh
most countries require that now
they you know they have uh it mandatory for for the the uh at least the young men
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
i do n't know about the young women
i do n't know if they have to serve in the military too
yeah
a lot
yeah
well you take israel
i mean everybody does
yeah
i do n't think it 's a bad idea
teaches teaches a lot
i mean i went in the service when i was eighteen and uh stayed in for ten years
uh-huh
is that right
yeah
uh did a lot of growing up
i bet
you have to
yeah
yeah
my father had been in the military
i did n't do it myself
my father had
and that 's uh how he put himself through school basically
yeah
he came from a poor immigrant family
and he did n't have a chance to uh you know
the family wasn't wealthy
so he had to do something to put himself through school
do it himself
and he did
and he was very successful
well my parents wanted to send me to college
and i was dead set against it
you know i had wanderlust you know
yeah
and i got in
and after after wasting the first six years partying and everything else i decided uh-huh time to settle down and do something
so i started to work on my education
yeah
course my job was such that i did n't i could n't do it as much as i wanted
uh-huh
and still i ended up going two semesters when i got out just to get my degree
that 's pretty good
but i 've been in school ever since
that 's good
yeah
i guess
yeah
that 's uh
i do n't know
there 's other kinds of service to the country that could be done you know
yeah
i mean if you do n't like
i mean working in the national parks uh working clean up the roadsides
sure
exactly
i mean i 've always felt that people on welfare should be required to spend at least part of their time *why no slash not all the time because that takes away from their opportunity to look for a job but at least some of their time to look for to go out and clean up the roads you know
oh yeah absolutely
i mean
all these all this money that we 're throwing away to pay people to go out and do things when we 're paying all these welfare recipients
and if they 're able-bodied people i do n't see any problem at all with having them go out there and and if nothing else get a group of them together and take them around to old folks places and let them cut the yards paint the houses
yeah
yeah
we 'd learn service to other people in this country
sure
sure
so i 'm
get something out of that money
country would benefit
yeah
i 've
i mean uh
yeah
yeah
my next door neighbor when i was growing up worked for the unemployment division
and his sole job was just tracking down people who were getting benefits and able-bodied
and
that right
yeah
and he he had all kinds of horror stories
you know these guys go down there and get their unemployment checks
and back back in those days they also use to give you uh booklets good for uh clothing and gas and things like this
yeah
they get all this stuff together and sit down and have poker games you know
yeah
and i 'm i i have a hard time dealing with that
what i hear one time i think it was on paul harvey 's uh radio segment that he said that if the money that goes into welfare each year was to be given directly to the people without all the middle people in the government bureaucracy each person would receive like forty-five thousand dollars
uh-huh
i mean i was astounded
i do n't even make that
no
i know
i you you think about you think about the layer of bureaucracy between the money and the recipient
yeah
and somebody 's taking that away
and and there 's probably there 's easily probably six or seven times that amount being spent on the bureaucracy
yeah
no doubt
you know it 's it 's it 's totally ridiculous
and now i i i uh started out when i first got in graduate school
i was going into public administration
and uh quite honestly i just got so fed up with it i just could n't stand it any more
is that right
yeah
i mean this is the kind of thing you look at
yeah
you sit there
and when you 're writing up budgets you wonder okay how much money do we need
well you need x number dollars for the recipients
but you need x number dollars to administer the program
well just ridiculous
yeah
this is ridiculous
it 's sad
it is
it 's pathetic
i mean there 's got to be a different way
there 's got to be a better way
but it 'll never happen
i mean these these people out here getting that money are big voting blocks
yeah
yeah
what would happen if the required young people to do service to the country
what should they get in return i wonder
like uh
i think i think there ought to be some kind of assistance as far as uh
and i would limit it strictly to something like tuition assistance
yeah
give an incentive
educational or vocational training or something
yeah
something that 's going to help them along the way
and they 'll help the country eventually too because rather than having a bunch of uneducated people we can have educated people
sure
i mean
well this
i mean i mean look at the statistics
and that 's only going to help
i mean it 's sad
one in five americans ca n't read
yeah
adults that is ca n't even read
and and we 've got the lowest rates of the civilized countries in science and math
yeah
i mean what are we what are we becoming
we 're becoming a service country
as opposed to what we were twenty years ago
yeah
we were an industrial giant
and now we 're we 're not going to do it because everybody is beating us at the game
we taught them how to do it
and they they did it better than we do
yeah
simple as that
because they have the ambition i guess
yeah
simple as that
yeah
which is good for them
but on the other hand we kind of lose out
yeah
it 's terrible for us
i think that if uh young people had service to the country might give them more ambition because they learn that serving other people is a good thing
yeah
yeah
and and it can be good for them too
yeah
oh yeah
i mean even even the greedy kids that we 've got now
oh god you go to the mall
and you see you know fourteen year old kids flaunting money because the parents give them money to go down and play video games all night you know
i know
for what
i know
give me the money
and i 'll i 'll teach them something good
well you know you know why they do it is so they can get them out of the house
yeah
yeah
uh that 's my other complaint
parents aren't parents any more
no
they 've they 've relinquished their parenting
yeah
one of the other subjects is do you think the public school systems are in trouble
yeah
well as a substitute teacher for a year i i can say yes
yeah
i mean i talked with somebody else about that another time
and you know when i 's in graduate school working on my master 's degree in math i was uh teaching as part of my part of the program
and i just love teaching
that was a lot that 's probably the most fun i had
and uh it helped me out because i learned things and learned how to do things differently
yeah
uh-huh
and when uh when come time to get out of school i thought boy i 'd like to teach
but you know for for what
yeah
you know i do n't want to live in a little one bedroom apartment the rest of my life
exactly
i mean that that 's a sad thing to think
and that 's kind of selfish on my part
and i admit that
well in a way it is
but you have to look out for yourself you know
yeah
that 's right
i mean that 's
and when we pay garbage men more than we pay teachers
that 's wrong
yeah
gosh
i mean
i 'm not saying that garbage men should be paid less
i saying teachers should be paid more
no
i mean yeah
they do an absolutely necessary job
i mean i i have a great deal of admiration for these people who can go out there and do that
yeah
but uh i mean there 's there 's a sense of priorities here too
yeah
you know we need
what 's more important picking up the garbage or educating our kids
yeah
they both have their place
yeah
they they
sure
but you know when it gets right down to it
i mean one 's
i mean on the other hand i mean you take a garbage man in new york city starts out at twenty-six thousand dollars
that 's pretty good
well i bet you there 's a whole bunch of homeless people up there who would take that job for thirteen thousand dollars a year
yeah
i mean my other pet peeve is unions
yeah
oh yeah
you know it 's just it 's it 's ridiculous the way unions have gone
there was a time when unions were needed
and they served a good function
and they served a good function
but there are enough laws on the books now that unions are outdated
and they 're only there to perpetuate their own their own power structure
i remember the company my dad worked for the people there went on strike against the management
it was a steel manufacturing place
and they uh
this was during a time when the import steel was so cheap
and they were having a hard time
and they told the strikers there look
we need you to come back and get this stuff done
or else we 're going to be out of business
and they would n't come back
so they went bankrupt
yeah
and and they all lost their jobs
sure
and and and that 's really what happened to the steel industry in this country
and it 's like you know
yeah
so many times i mean you had the uh the coal miners and steel workers going out at the same time
and well that took care of that industry
that 's right
and and then and i 'll tell you
detroit worked awfully hard on on stopping car manufacturing in this country
and they 're trying to do that now with the imports
yeah
i mean you know we 've never caught up
and i do n't think we ever will
it 'll be a tough road though
yeah
i mean here it is
and we 've got we 've got to go into partnership with the japanese to build cars
yeah
you know and they only did it because they i guess they were embarrassed that they 're so good at it
yeah
that 's about right
gosh
yeah
well back to the original subject
yeah
i think youngsters ought to go out and do some public service
i do n't care what kind it is
it teaches them pride in their country
yeah
and pride in themselves too
that 's right
they could they could i mean you could organize something just within your community same old thing
yeah
i mean
that 's right
that 's like eagle scouts
sure
uh-huh
and that 's a great idea
i think they ought to take them and i do n't know just have sort of like a a a manpower pool and say okay look
we need somebody
okay
we 're going to talk about the public school system what 's wrong with it an or if anything is wrong with it and what we can do about it what should be done about it
okay
fantastic
well one thing that pops into my mind real quick is uh about the uh funding of the the school system right now
yeah
evidently uh that 's that 's a big problem
yeah
it 's amazing uh
i always thought that teachers never got paid nearly enough i mean to be doing what they 're doing uh
right
when i was in college i i enjoyed teaching
'cause i did some teaching part-time
and i really enjoyed that
but i would n't want to go teach high school or junior high
it just you know all the problems
oh lord i mean yeah
an you talk about stress and pressure
i tell you what
it 's uh
yeah
they 're putting in fifty sixty hours a week
i 'm sure because they 've got to grade papers and get class stuff ready
do
right
and you know and they 're being paid probably half what most people being paid
exactly
and
and we 're paying basketball people you know millions of dollars a year for for what you know
that 's right
and then they uh poof it off you know do like tarpley
yeah
but uh i
what gets me is i ca n't believe that congress uh or our state legislature ca n't come up with uh some kind of workable means to have funds for the school
you know it 's uh
i just do n't understand that
yeah
it 's uh
now do you have little kids or what
no uh
sure do n't
my wife and i 've just been married about two years
but i have a sister that 's a uh school teacher
and uh
yeah
yeah
my wife and i have a a three year old almost four and a a two year old
okay
so we 're looking at the the older one going to school next year not not well not this coming fall but the year after that
okay
so it 's getting close
yeah
he 's going to be going to kindergarten
so
right
so you know we 're we 're thinking about that
what 's that going to be like
are they going to be taught nothing
or they going be taught something
we 're going to we 're going to be involved in our child 's education
we 're going to be teaching him what we can at home of course because uh i guess we do n't trust the school system which is very sad uh
right
but but if it does n't start at home it 's not going to go anywhere you know
exactly
right
that 's true
and we 're going to try to teach him good values because you know when when they get to upper level school and they start teaching them well hey if you can play football or basketball that 's what 's important not if you can read or write or do or understand some science you know
exactly
i mean give me a break
that 's that 's that 's bogus
right
right
well and uh you know one thing my wife and i 've talked about are uh private schools you know whether uh uh we would want to invest in in private schools as they 're growing up because you know just in the dallas area um we 're not real comfortable with the with the public schools
yeah
and dallas uh school district just recently got an advised status because of their low quality schooling
right
i could n't believe that
right
you know one that 's one reason we bought a house here in plano
we were hoping you know well the school district 's going to be good you know for resale value and so on and so forth
yeah
but uh i can definitely uh see on down the road you know where we do have kids and are getting to that age that 's going to be a definite concern
yeah
we talked you talked about before about the school funding
i think there 's only going to be one solution to school funding which i do n't think will be necessarily the best way
but i think what 's going to have to happen is there 's going to have to be tuition for grade school and junior high and high school kids
that 's the only way they 're going to fund it because if they start raising taxes for property and people are going to throw a fit
that 's
yeah
and you know that 's
taxes right now are political suicide you know
oh yeah
and i do n't think any politician 's going to do that
so
yeah
and the only thing they they would think of would be tuition you know
if it works at colleges it will work down below
right
and you know that 's going to that 's going to affect the people that are having kids in school of course which is probably the only fair thing to do
but it will be hard for those that people that have have in school because they have to pay out even more
exactly
and you know it 's going to really hurt the the middle class uh people i think because uh they 're the ones that will probably have to to carry the brunt of the load
oh yeah
that 's right
so uh
and most of the problems with kids in school carrying guns and and knives and everything
i mean good grief what 's
yeah
now that 's that 's just unbelievable to me you know
i ca n't believe that
i mean when i was in junior high and high school that never happened
you never heard about that
well yeah
we did n't we did n't even think about it you know
no
and now you know what do we have now
you know got kids that either got a you know a magnum gun school
like good grief
right
i mean i 'd i 'd be afraid to be in school i mean teaching or even being a student
and think what what 's it going to be like for my my youngest an my oldest son when he goes to school
what 's going to happen
i mean i i 'm afraid for him to go
exactly
right
but there again you ca n't hold them back
another reason
and you want to encourage them you know to to be active and everything in school
but uh you know with all the peer pressure that 's going on with all the negative things it is uh it 's a tough environment to be growing up in
yeah
and lot tougher than it was when i was going to school
and that was
well i was i graduated high school in nineteen seventy-nine
so
okay
that was what twelve years ago i guess
right
so you know it 's lot different now
and what 's it going to be like in another twelve years when my uh oldest son is in high school
that 's right
that 's right
i 'm afraid to i 'm afraid to even think about it
that yeah that is a scary thought
but uh i do n't know
i i guess what you have to do is just uh keep in uh you know encouraging them and and uh uh try to be open with them so that you can deal with the problems as they come up
that 's all you can do
yeah
and
you got to you got to be your child 's best friend i guess even when they 're a teenager and they you know are kind of standoffish
right
still you got to be their best friend because when they 've got problems who they going to go to their friends that are dealing drugs or or your parents you know
exactly
an and if they go to their friends dealing drugs they 're going to be in even worse shape
that 's right
and and the schools do n't do n't really encourage to stay away from that you know
the schools are there to teach history and that we fought the civil war etcetera etcetera
they do n't teach them good values like drugs are bad
i maybe i 'm wrong because i haven't you know been in that kind of environment for a long time
but it just is amazing you know
right
need to teach them good values
that 's true
that 's true
and uh
of course if i say this is a good value someone else is going to stand up and say oh no
and the a c l u is going to get after them and have a lawsuit which is going to take twenty years to resolve you know
right
well and i think uh you touched on it you know
you 've got to start them at the home you know
yeah
that 's where they that 's where they get the the deep rooted values
and and and uh and that 's about right
that 's all you can do
then you just have to hope and pray that that everything uh works out works out okay
so
that 's right
well i got to be going
so uh
okay
well hey i appreciate the call
nice talking to you today
you to
have a good life uh
hi wanet is his last
how are you
i 'm doing fine

use too
use to
but none none right now
how come uh you do n't have any now
you get tired of them
well i i live in an apartment building
and and uh and and it it it 's just not feasible you know
yeah
i 'd love to have a dog you know
i 've got a little doggy uh that i 've had quite uh quite a long time
in fact she just turned sixteen years old new year 's eve
ah
and uh
is she
i beg your pardon
what is she
she 's uh uh uh a poodle
uh a toy poodle a toy poodle
and she 's
ah
ah
my i got my mom a teacup little mutt not too long ago
this is a little bigger than a teacup
yeah
and uh it 's funny how uh how i i uh acquired this animal
uh when i was uh married my uh ex-wife had said that she had a friend who had a little puppy that she needed
uh the woman needed someone to baby-sit
and uh this is what she had told the kids
and she even told me that
and after the two week period was up uh she then informed me that the woman no longer wanted the little puppy and wanted to know if we wanted to keep it
well after you had an animal for a couple of weeks it 's uh you become you become attached to it
oh for sure
oh yeah
so i 've had this dog now for for sixteen years
and she 's been a lot of company
uh she 's uh however getting a little old
and things are starting to fail
uh i i live alone now
and she stays in the house all day while i go to work
and uh she 's been holding herself pretty well the uh up until you know recently where she 's been having accidents in the house because she either is losing control or she forgets where she is
and uh i find a little present on the floor sometimes when i come home
but she 's she 's usually pretty good
yes
well my my mother has one that 's uh
it 's uh it 's uh teacup
and uh it 's made such a difference for her
but you know just i you know
the way my mom 's presence countenance is just just for having a puppy
but you know having this dog
she 's had it for i guess three years now oh possibly four
uh-huh
but uh it was it it 's it 's really made such a difference for her
i really would like to uh
i 'm a disabled person
uh-huh
so i 'm unable to to really take care of a pet
and if that weren't so i would certainly have one
i just i just
it frustrates me sometimes not being able to have a dog
yeah
huh well you might want to get yourself uh an animal that does n't require much attention like a cat
oh yeah
well yeah
uh i i i typically am not a cat person
i have a friend that uh has on occasion uh brought her cat over for me to keep for you know from time to time
and this cat is like no other cat i have ever seen
and uh it would sleep on my chest you know
yeah
it 's just it 's just a great cat
but
well my my personal preference is is a dog
uh i do n't know that uh that i would ever want a cat
oh i like cats
i just would n't want to own one
uh they 're not uh they 're they 're affectionate
well you do n't own cats
but they
yeah
i do n't know
i ca n't seem to communicate with a cat like i can with my dog
yeah
you they they own you or or you know grant you with you their presence you know
yeah
right
yeah
right
that
yes
we 're supposed to appreciate them
well my my dog when i came home uh when i come home in the evenings my dog greets me at the door
i do n't know that a cat would do that uh
yeah
i used to have a cat that could read me better than any human being in my life
yeah
i could just walk in the door
and she knew whether to to to quietly come up to me or to just run and knock me over
i mean she really could pick up on my mood uh the way i walked in the door
yeah
yeah
it was uh uncanny like a
huh i i think uh in a way we 're able to read each other pretty well because uh she knows when i 'm upset and i know when she 's not feeling good too
so
yeah
i know like when she has an accident i know she 's not doing it on purpose
when when she was younger she used to do that to get even with me
yeah
uh and and you know some people might not believe that
but but but uh i do
sure
oh absolutely
like if i if i put her in a room all by herself and close the door and leave her there for a few hours uh because i was going out she would uh break something or rip up the carpet or do something just to uh to to let me know that she was unhappy with what i did
really
yeah
that 's the way
well i had that cat that i mentioned alfie
one morning you know the first thing you do is you get up and you you you feed this cat something and and you make sure that it can get to its litter box
well for some reason during the night the door was not quite wide enough for it to get through
uh-huh
and uh the next morning uh when my roommate got up and and uh did not feed it right away it decided that that it was going to protest
and so it jumped up on my bed and anointed my blanket for me looking looking at me eye to eye all the time while it was doing it
all right have i got your attention now
oh yes
animals have a way of talking
alfie did
i tell you if i could have gotten a hold of that cat that day
i i do n't know that i 'd uh that i 'd trade my dog in for the world
uh it was about two years ago she got sick on me
and i took her to the uh to the vet 's because she wasn't eating and and uh she wasn't able to jump
she you know lost all her activity
and uh she stayed there for one day
and the doctor called me up and said uh she had a low white cell count and that uh she wasn't she was dying and uh suggested that i take her to a working dog hospital animal hospital
so i took his suggestion
and i uh took the the dog to a hospital the dog hospital there
and they said they 'd keep her there for three days
well she ended staying there five days at a hundred and something dollars a day because she was in intensive care
it cost me over five hundred dollars
ouch
plus the the uh the vet sent me a bill for what he did
and uh then she recouped
she was okay for a couple of years
and then she got sick on me again
and i brought her to a different vet this time
and i told the vet what medication i had given her and everything
and uh he gave me the medication the same medication that i gave her the last time
and she was okay
and she 's been okay every since
it 's been about two years now
huh well that 's great
it really is
i i 'm glad that she was able to pull out of it that way and so cheaply the second time
yeah
well the see the problem is if if the if someone would have came up to me and said it 's going to cost you five hundred dollars to keep your dog alive
what do you want to do
i probably would have had second thoughts
yeah
of course you would
but what they well what they do is is they say well it 's going to cost you know twenty dollars for tests and forty dollars for this
and and you know and it creeps up on you
you do n't know that uh you know
you really you do n't know what it 's going to until it 's all over
uh to give you an example my mom had an elderly cat who uh whoever evidently got a hold of it
and uh the cat got sick
so she took the cat to the vet
and she had the cat there for two days
and then the cat died
so the doctor had called her up and said uh your cat died
and you owe me this bill
and oh by the way do you want me to to bury the cat
so it cost her three hundred dollars uh
and she did n't get the cat back
so yeah
they had to pay for all the medical uh bills that the cat ran up plus the burial expenses
and uh you know she just brought the cat in because he wasn't feeling good
so that that was kind of a surprise
really
geez
at
yeah
you kind of wonder what really happened
yeah
well even the you know
they they claimed they did the best that they could have have
and then the cat uh died
so
my goodness
i 'm i 'm looking for another cat for them uh
i i 've i 've got a little kitten uh that 's still uh just being born right now
so another five or six weeks i 'll be bringing the little kitten over to uh to my folks
well that that that that will make their day
yeah
i i think it will
because they 're both in their in their seventies and uh the cat uh although it 's a little bit of work for them sometimes it turns it turns out to be uh uh a pleasant experience for them
uh i think they enjoy that
only work initially
yeah
for cats anyway you know
yeah
well listen
it 's been a pleasure talking to you
well the same here
and you take care
okay
bye now
maybe we 'll talk again sometimes
okay
what is that sound
that 's my buzzer at the door
oh okay
i 'll let you go
okay
right
thank you
uh so what do you do to exercise
uh
i uh weight train uh three days on and one day off
uh-huh
i uh ride bicycles uh fifteen twenty miles i do n't know maybe three times maybe four times a week
i play basketball uh couple times a week
i play softball one night a week
uh that 's what i do
um
what about yourself
that 's pretty impressive
uh i guess i bicycle
uh the amount varies
as much as a hundred and fifty miles a week
uh-huh
uh i guess a play softball one night a week
and i backpack a lot over the summer
oh really
yeah
that 's that 's about the extent of it
i mean i do n't do any of those things particularly you know for exercise
but uh i guess the bicycling is the one thing i 'll sort of like do if i feel like i need to go exercise
uh but i do it mostly for fun
yeah
uh what do you ride uh like a bunch of hills or pretty flat
it it it varies
uh out near my house is pretty hilly
uh but sometimes i bike to work which is about uh a fifteen mile trip each way
and that 's mostly flat
how long does that take you to get to work
uh about forty-five fifty minutes
how how does that work work out with uh storing your bike and showering and all that
yeah
it can be a pain
uh basically uh i work on a campus
so i can store my bike in my office and walk across the uh campus to the uh gym use the shower there
uh-huh
uh but it 's it 's enough of a pain that i did it consistently one year
i would commute every day uh
but it just became such a pain
i mean we 're talking you know forty-five fifty minutes for biking uh and sometimes longer if you had adverse wind and then another half an hour you know to cool down and take a shower and all this kind of stuff
right
it was a big hunk hunk of the day
uh and then of course another hour to get back home
uh so i 've been doing that less and and concentrating more on you know light biking when i get home on the evening and then you know some more on the weekends
yeah
do you ride a lot of rallies or a lot of those around there
not so much
uh i guess mostly i bike on my own
i 've got a touring bike uh though i haven't gone on any extended trips with it
uh-huh
how about you
what kind of biking do you do
uh well actually my wife just got me into it
and i did an did an internship at the institute for aerobics research in dallas the cooper clinic
uh-huh
and i learned all the health benefits of you know
i was a solid weight trainer
uh-huh
and all i did was weights and aerobic exercise
and then my wife got me into the aerobic exercise and said you really need to do it
so once i got into this uh internship i learned all the physiological advantages to it
uh-huh
so i began a program couple i do n't know probably three or four weeks ago
and i did my first bike rally this saturday
i did uh forty forty miles
um
and uh that 's the longest i 've ever ridden so far
i usually you know fifteen or twenty
uh-huh
and it was it was kind of hilly
and it was pretty tough
but uh i 'm looking at uh doing a lot more of it because you know my wife is really into it
oh i see
and i i kind of held her back a little bit this this weekend
she wanted to go go go
but you know she wanted to stay with me
uh-huh
it 's good to have a partner
yeah
it really is
are you think of doing any like centuries or
yeah
that would be cool sometime if i could you know work up to that
uh-huh
yeah
i just wondered if you were going to do that mostly or more like you know uh uh touring like from vermont or you know that kind of thing
oh
i mean people seem to get into different aspects
one is more of a distance
and one 's more just you know
they want to put some equipment on their bike and go for a tour
i 've never really looked into that
that you know that 's
my wife would just love that
uh-huh
and i may do that sometime
there again i 'm just kind of a fledgling into this
uh-huh
i 've it 's kind of funny
i called this number
and i was just reading through a bicycle magazine and going through all the different tours coming up
yeah
yeah
i mean around texas you you got about five or six
if you live around the dallas area you got five or six every weekend to choose from because they 're really into it
oh that 's nice
um
bicycling is really big here
i did n't know that and you know until i came down here and kind of caught the fever
wow
yeah
because i lived in indiana all my life
and you know you may say see one or two guys on a bicycle that or above the age of fifteen or something
uh-huh
but other than that it 's nothing up there like it is down here
yeah
i 'm not sure why that is
i mean generally in the midwest it seems to be less much less
i mean maybe it 's because of the winters uh or maybe just because you know there 's there 's a lot more flat lands you know out in the west
probably
yeah
so it makes biking a better alternative for transportation
yeah
it there 's a lot of bikers around here
it 's it 's really neat
uh-huh
there are a lot of a lot of resources a lot of magazines and stuff
little texas bicyclist is like a little newspaper that comes out every month
um
it 's free
just go to the bike shock bike shop and pick it up
and it 's got all the rides coming up
so i guess i 'm going to be busy about every saturday this summer going to a different ride
oh that 's terrific
yeah
see a little bit of texas i 've never seen before
uh-huh
so uh how long have you been biking
oh i guess as an adult for just about the past uh three years or so
uh you know i guess last time i did it before that was college which was about ten years ago
yeah
and uh yeah
i guess i just never really thought about it much for a while uh until i suddenly discovered all my friends were basically biking a lot
and so i thought i 'd try it too
have you ever had a uh it 's kind of slightly off the subject but you ever had a uh a blood workup done recently or since you 've been biking to see if it
no
i haven't
no
because it really from what i understand it really improves your uh cholesterol
um
and you know it uh it kind of knocks down two of the big risk categories for coronary artery disease which is uh uh low cardiovascular fitness and also uh you know the cholesterol
uh-huh
it gives you increased h d ls and decreases your l d ls
oh that 's great
yeah
so
yeah
i 've i 've definitely noticed it 's had a good effect on my pulse rate my resting pulse
yeah
you know it gets it down to about forty
really
yeah
that 's good
yeah
you say you ride about a hundred hundred fifty miles a week
yeah
man
that 's that 's hard-core
on average
yeah
when do you get to begin with the winters and all that
what time of the year do you usually embark on your
do you ride inside if you ca n't ride outside
no
i 'm not that hard-core
i mean there are some people
in fact a lot of people will ride outside in the snow
they 've got a uh mountain bike you know with the big knobby tires
yeah
and i do n't do that
i basically i i pretty much lay off for the winter
uh i was thinking of getting rollers for the last winter you know because it will help your balance when you 're indoor training
um
uh but i just you know more or less stocked like an exercise bike and that kind of thing uh
but yeah
i mean winters are kind of a problem
so i 'm more or less out of shape now that i 've been biking i guess this year for just a couple of weeks
uh-huh
uh but you know up here it 's only stopped snowing since then
yeah
uh but yeah
it 's it 's it 's it 's pretty good
it 's uh
the main the main thing i guess for me is just to enjoy it because once it starts seeming like you know exercise and a chore i 'll lay off it more
right
so you uh change up your routes a lot and keep a
oh yeah
yeah
i try to go someplace pretty different you know every week
i rotate around uh about four different routes uh from my house
or i 'll sometimes come in the school
it 's nice coming
it 's it 's nice riding to school because it 's all along a canal path uh
because it 's just it 's along the erie canal up here
so what school is it
uh university of rochester
oh okay
yeah
so it 's fairly picturesque
yeah
and uh so it 's it 's it 's a good ride
as long as you 're not doing it every day it 's a good ride
yeah
that 's true
sounds neat
yeah
it 's kind of
i was wondering if i was going to talk with someone that never has exercised before and does n't want to and everything else
but got a guy that rides a hundred and fifty miles a week
that 's uh motivating
yeah
that 's really good
well good talking to you
oh it was good talking to you
and keep up the good work
okay
you too
all right
take care
bye
bye
okay
uh far as you know crime in the cities i 'm sure like in yours it 's pretty pretty bad
uh probably the biggest thing we 've got going now is the robberies
and theft and probably murder are the two top ones that we have
uh-huh
how about you
uh well i do n't actually live in the city
but i 'd probably say that 's roughly right
i mean crimes against property seem to outnumber crimes against life
but i i think with the current war on drugs and all this kind of stuff i 'd say probably the police department would claim the number one crimes crimes are probably solicitation of prostitution uh and sale of drugs
uh-huh
probably right if you look at it from that stand point
uh-huh
what uh
is there anything uh that you particularly are concerned with in your particular area as far as security and that sort of thing
uh where i live now it 's it 's not so bad
i mean i can basically leave my front door unlocked and not have to worry about it
uh but i do have friends that live in the city
and i think that they get a lot of fallout from this war on drug thing uh just because there are like crack houses you know on their street and stuff like this
uh-huh
do you live in a real small town or or out in the country
i live out in the country
yeah
how far out from the city i mean do you
i 'm about fifteen miles out
about fifteen miles
i live in a little suburb uh which is i guess from dallas is twelve miles or so
uh-huh
but it 's pretty congested
we are considered in the country
um
but it does n't really feel like you 're in the country
um
our major crimes in our immediate town uh is probably robberies house robberies and very few instances of you know alcohol drugs uh reported
uh-huh
however i 'm sure they 're there
uh-huh
but uh right now our neighborhood is running about uh eighty percent of the homeowners have been robbed sometime during their their uh existence in that neighborhood
wow
that 's huge
and since that time everybody 's got some sort of burglar system or you know uh burglar alarms uh and including the out uh the outer perimeter type uh devices sensors and things like that
uh-huh
uh-huh
it 's cut back you know considerably
but it it just shifts it from our neighborhood to another neighborhood to other neighborhood
so it still uh remains city wide pretty pretty high
are there are there any theories on why this is happening
uh i would say the majority of it 's happening during the day uh between probably ten in the morning and three in the afternoon
uh-huh
most
but why
why is it happening
well most families most families are young
and both people are working
uh-huh
so they 're happening during the hours they 're gone from work
uh-huh
uh so uh i would say that 's probably their prime motivation
they 'll they 'll stock your house and uh look at your pattern and then go from there
so they 're professionals
uh they classify most of them as professionals
um
uh you get a few of them that are a little bit sloppier uh just taking uh you know just junk items that they they can just get you know ten to twenty bucks for real quick
uh-huh
probably the biggest items that uh that you get in our neighborhood or would be the high classed automobiles
the you know mercedes volvos things that they can get you know big dollars for and the jewelry are the major targets
uh-huh
guns that sort of stuff
um
very few you know penny penny ante stuff
well what do you think can be done to reduce that sort of crime
well uh the police force for one
i think they could uh definitely add to the police force and the type equipment that they use
uh it 's
oh right now i think we are about thirty thousand people
and there 's only eight officers that patrol for thirty for that amount of people which is not very many
uh-huh
uh-huh
right
and
but i mean that 's going to tend to
i mean it seems to me that sort of approach will tend to simply make the cost of committing the crime slightly higher
in other words you 've increased the probability of somebody being caught a little bit
the real question is how do you convince people not to commit such crimes in the first place
well the
course in our particular state uh we have the prison overcrowding whatever
so they 're giving the early release uh
right
they 're doing that in our state too
yeah
and and it 's
i think what they need to do is stop building more jails and start giving stiffer sentences uh
but for the
so you think that would be a deterrent
that would be certainly be a deterrent
uh-huh
and uh not necessarily you know give in to their uh human rights desires
you know if they 're overcrowded just keep cramming them in there till they just suffocate uh
well what about an innocent person who happens to have been found guilty
uh i think they 'd have to go to extra measures to make sure a person 's guilty you know in a lot of cases
course i i know you ca n't be a hundred percent foolproof
right
uh
so you 'd you 'd rather see it harder to convict somebody
i 'd rather see it a little bit harder and have a little bit more evidence uh to convict somebody
uh-huh
and then those convicted especially of you know murder and and uh you know major crimes uh to reach the life sentences and you know death penalties and follow-through with that
uh-huh
huh
uh especially you know in the case of murder
right
uh i know in my case i my wife and daughter were kidnapped during a house robbery back in eighty-five
oh wow
oh my goodness
and we caught the individuals got caught
we uh we went through the court system and all that sort of thing
uh-huh
and uh you know two counts of kidnapping uh you know the the forty-five to the head you know just the the mental anguish and the whole nine yards uh you know the guy only got five years
uh-huh
right
wow
and you know he was out within two months because of the parole system
so what what
did you did you sue him under the civil system
do what now
did you sue him under the civil system
no
i 'm not real familiar with that
well you could probably sue him for mental anguish or something right and try to get money from him
oh
and
well the insurance companies and all that tried to tried to go after him
and they said well you know he they 're he has no job
he has nothing
there 's nothing that he has that that you could go after
yeah
makes you wish that had uh still had indentured servitude for this sort of thing
yeah
uh very
but they give the guy a job in prison and make him pay his damn debt
yeah
they do n't do that here
course they pay them
but they do n't you do n't
you or the insurance companies never see any of that money
yeah
that 's too bad
and uh you know and they 're right now they 're reluctant to go after him because they 're you know they 're they 're repeat offenders
they uh been in jail before
uh-huh
uh-huh
they 've been released you know several times which is another uh deal i hate to see
uh-huh
uh-huh
but uh you know basically the guy commits you know three major crimes and and uh and car theft on top of it destroys my car
yeah
i i think that 's
yeah
yeah
and we 're out you know uh you know fifteen thousand dollars
and you know the guy gets out in two months
that 's awful
and he goes out and commits it again
fact he 's back in jail now
so what what uh
gives you sympathy for the vigilantes
yeah
what what deterrent does he really have
yeah
yeah
i think in our in our particular neighborhood vigilantism is becoming a real real possibility
uh-huh
uh we 've had a couple instances where break ins where the people have actually you know shot the people
oh my god
and uh return offenders have
they 've actually waited for them where they 've robbed you know particular neighborhood
they 'll rob one house
then other people will wait up you know and wait for somebody to do something else try to take it in their own hands
right
course it does n't always work out in their favor
right
but uh nevertheless i think people are just getting fed up and saying you know you ca n't arrest all of us
uh-huh
you can you know you can get some of us
right
you ca n't get all of us
uh-huh
uh and we 're beginning to see more and more of that
and that that 's a deterrent too if you think the home owner might be armed right and awake
yeah
here you break in
and you 're going to get shot
yeah
that 's i mean that 's certainly a possibility in in
we have had a few cases where the guy has broken in you know during the middle of the night and gotten himself shot to death
uh-huh
and uh it helps for a while
uh-huh
but then just another different set of people come in
and most of the people are transients from out outside of the state
huh
uh i would say probably eighty percent of them that are caught they 're from places like up in oklahoma and louisiana arkansas you know across the the border
wow
so you know people who do n't readily read the newspapers in our town or whatever
uh-huh
it 's not many from the local communities
uh-huh
but uh it 's a problem
and i i just i think that the court systems need to be more accurate in in stiffer in their penalties
yeah
would be a definite deterrent
and and uh giving the uh police uh agencies a little bit more jurisdiction over what they do when they when they catch these people
yeah
uh-huh
i mean i i tend to agree with you
i think uh what i would like to see is number one completely getting rid of these victimless crimes uh there 's no reason to enforce those and spend time and money doing it and and worry about these things where people are getting hurt
right
and i think one of the big things that you can do is to increase deterrence is uh if someone is found guilty of a uh felony level offense they lose their citizenship
and they lose their constitutional rights you know
uh-huh
and just a lot of things that we 're trying to worry about you know protecting these people from we just do n't protect them
i know like in my wife 's case they made her feel like the criminal
i know
and i think i think that 's ridiculous
they they went to all all
okay
have you painted something lately
yes
i have
that room i showed you
yeah
and then since then we have painted the bedroom
oh yeah
another bedroom
yeah
i showed you that one too did n't i
the brown one
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
the one that looks like a fudgesicle
oh yeah
yeah
oh heavens
well i painted the outside of my house and one bathroom
yeah
but i get i have that problem with the the ceiling you know the uh the blown blown ceiling you know where you get around the edge
oh yeah
well that is hard
now i asked janice or somebody recently how you do that uh when you paint the ceilings you know where you have got that textured stuff that they have special rollers that are real soft and furry that you paint that with
uh-huh
uh-huh
well how do you get the edge though
how do you get the edge
the the straight edge
you just have to be real careful
oh i see
we use uh uh a two inch brush with uh on a slant
uh-huh
uh-huh
and that mostly does it even though you still make mistakes
but
huh well are you going to paint the outside of your house too
well yeah
i think i am going to do it this spring actually
oh really
yeah
there are six houses
see the people that own the house they uh pay for anything like that that we do as far as the the materials
oh nice
there are three houses on this street the same color of yellow out of six houses
yeah
so i am thinking i am going to change it to uh something you know
the brick is multi color mostly earth tones
uh-huh
oh that will be nice
huh
or two tone or two tone you know
yeah
there are some columns that could be painted a different color too
uh-huh
what color did you paint your house
white
on the out
but i have a problem
i ca n't get up high
and we ca n't paint the chimney
well you have got to get one of those ladders
we have one of those ladders
we are just not willing to get up that high
oh yeah
a friend of mine that lives out in your neighborhood he has done his house
and that is what he
i was out there last week
and he has finished everything except the chimney
well we did too
we did it in the fall
and it it 's just too high
it is really scary
but and the only thing i would consider doing a professional maybe doing that
yeah
but it
other than doing our own work i prefer it to a professional
well our house in new mexico it was stucco
but we had all this trim to paint and lots of it
yeah
and we did basically seventy-five percent of the house
and then i was afraid to do the eaves way up high and stuff
uh-huh
so i hired this man to come in and do it a young kid
uh-huh
and he came with with his own
what do you call those things
the blowers
no
those where you built like a rafter thing
oh oh oh oh i know what you are talking about uh
yeah
scaffold
scaffold
that 's it
he came and did it that way
and i think he charged me a hundred dollars to finish up
huh
and literally i would n't have done it with the scaffolds because all the places that i had left for him were above huge humongous cactus
its
yeah
and if he fell he was dead
and he knew that
so
oh my
so that was worth it getting a professional for that
yeah
plus he cleaned up my mess
oh i think that is what we might have to do with this chimney
but other than that it was pretty easy doing it ourself and caulking it and everything ourself
uh-huh
it wasn't too bad
i mean you think
how much did it cost you for the paint for the outside
shoot maybe a hundred and fifty
yeah
since it is a one story
but we did uh like two heavy coats over it
but then that way you know you are assured you did a good job than you are you know if you hire someone to do it
yeah
but that friend of mine that painted his house out there in your neighborhood he went to uh i guess to buy his paint
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
and yet he bought like seventeen gallons
my word
and anyway he when he checked out and he was using his charge card too they only charged him for one gallon of paint like thirteen bucks or something
uh-huh
uh-huh
oh my word
and he had he had the uh he had already carried a ladder outside and told her that
uh-huh
and she wrung all that stuff up and made a mistake on the price of the paint
uh-huh
so she had to start all over again
uh-huh
and when he got outside he noticed his receipt was like thirteen ninety-nine or something
oh my word
and he saw
so that was really worth it painting his own house
yeah
it was like over two hundred dollars worth of free stuff
oh my word
oh my word
well he really saved in that way
yeah
but yeah
i think we are going to do uh another bathroom
but i think i will probably just do it in a roller
i want to do it about the same color and just be a little
uh rollers are so messy
we never any more
oh i know
but it 's that it 's the textured wall
well a little paintbrush
so what do you think
uh the causes of crime
um i think it was imbalance of power in the united states
it 's causing the lower class to rebel
that 's why there 's such high crime
and uh there 's crime in uh young people because they do n't have role models
yeah
see too much crime on t v
and they think it 's the way to go
i do n't know
what do you think
what about
i agree with the upper and lower level you know
uh-huh
because that 's the lowest thing for themselves
plus there 's nobody for them to look up to
yeah
but i also blame some of it on parents
okay
because parents aren't parents
yeah
because i remember even when i was growing up
i 'm thirty-five
okay
i remember when i was growing up
and i had friends
they used to do stuff like you know go over to a store and steal stuff
my mother warned us it 's like i do n't care what your friends do
if you do it then that was it
yeah
and i knew that i would get in more trouble from my mother than from from anybody else
from anybody else
and i think that 's the basic is they have no morals any more
yeah
so they do n't care
yeah
so
yeah
i think i can agree with that too
but now as far as what they can do about it i do n't know
you ca n't make parents be parents
that 's true
you got to kind of make people want to do the right thing
you know
i do n't know how you do that
i guess if you gave the gave them jobs
that 's another problem with the united states
there 's no jobs any more
yeah
but
well i 've heard this one theory that if that if a kid commits a crime that uh instead of the prosecuting the kid they prosecute the parent
or both of them
that would work to a point
now to put the blame on the parent
well that 'd work to a point because some kids are just bad anyway
i do n't care what you do to them
yeah
you know
so i think it depends on how much trouble that kid has been in you know
yeah
because a a a child can get into anything
yeah
i do n't care how good you they are
yeah
at least one time
but now if this is a repeated thing
here with this child in juvenile
and or to me yeah both of them
yeah
because that means she 's still not doing what she 's supposed to do
because i just watched it on t v one night on one of them um twenty twenty forty-eight hours one of them shows where this boy had been stealing cars
uh-huh
yeah
i do n't know if you seen this
um
it was a little it was a little gang of them stealing cars you know
no
i did n't see it
i understand
and then when they caught him you know his mother sitting there
now they going to take me away from you
that meaned she was warned
yeah
but see by that i think sometimes it 's a little late
yeah
you know
but i 'm sure there 's something can be done
yeah
what about with adults
anything do any about adult crime
yeah
start prosecuting they
but really good instead of having a revolving door on the damn court system
yeah
well for one a major problem with that is the jails are overcrowded
well they should start with the
if they would get rid of
seems to me i know there 's a lot about court that people do n't understand
there 's more people in jail right now for child support okay then there are for people doing drugs
uh-huh
um
you ought to take all them little misdemeanor people
yeah
let them go
let them go
yeah
you know give them a fine whatever
make them do civic duty whatever
yeah
i mean seriously
put them fools in there
they ought to put those people to work
i call them all fools idiots whatever
yeah
little rock stars put all them in there
um
you know the murderers the drug dealers the user put them all in
jail you know
yeah
and let all the normal people go
yeah
you know because okay
if you write a bad check you go to jail right
yeah
let them people go
well
not let them go and get out of it
yeah
they you still have to punish them
let them go and pay their crime or their time doing something else you know like cleaning up the city or however they do their community time you know whatever that is
yeah
yeah
that 's
but do n't put them in jail because they 're not hardened criminals
yeah
and they 're they 're still they can provide for society
whereas some of them are so far gone that they ca n't do anything good for society
uh-huh
so
i do n't know
some people boy they got
i think the united states has got too many problems to be worrying about everybody else
yeah
that 's true
now how they going to fix it i do n't know
i do n't think there is a ready solution
no
i do n't think so either
uh
because the economy is down people you know the the the low man on the pole is getting more of the i guess the bulk of it
yeah
and he 's got to work extra hard just to make ends meet
and they keep taking more money from us
uh-huh
and people are get
and they do n't have any incentive to work if we 're just going to take fifty percent of it
yeah
might as well steal
then they do n't have to pay taxes on it
that 's it
yeah
so you know they i i i know that 's bad but you know just like texas now
uh-huh
they could have had a lottery
they do n't want a lottery
why not
i would rather pay for a lottery a dollar two three dollars whatever i 'm paying you know a week or whatever and never see any of that money than to have them take a portion of my paycheck
they 'd have a
yeah
yeah
because you know they take
and uncle sam takes his
the social security which probably wo n't be here when i get that old you know
um
because we 're paying for social security they using now
yeah
who 's going to pay for mine
i do n't know
but it 's it 's
i 'm not counting on it
no
you do n't count on social security
yeah
but it 's it 's
that 's what i 'm saying
they need to do something else
um
but
crime is going to go up as long as the economy stays down
yeah
and it 's going to get worse
yeah
that 's just like last night they killed them people in that store
where you at
i 'm in raleigh north carolina
oh
no wonder you do n't know that
well where are you from
i 'm in dallas
okay
but last night they killed uh uh four people in a chain food
oh man
and killed them
well it was two stores side by side
uh-huh
one was a store and one was like a a fast food place
chicken or something i do n't know
yeah
anyway they raped the women beat them all up including the women
i mean they just beat them
stuck them in the freezer and then shot them all
ow
why was you know why
why did they do in the freezer
you know why did n't they just
if they was going to lock them just lock them in the freezer take the money you know
yeah
they did n't have to kill them or rape them or anything
um
um
that 's awful
yeah
we still get some in raleigh
i mean not not too often real bad ones
uh-huh
but
it 's just getting really ridiculous down here
i wish i could move somewhere where this you know you got to like in the country
i do n't think there 's anywhere where there isn't going to be crimes
well i think if it 's
the town is smaller
uh-huh
and everybody knows everybody
yeah
it 's harder to come in there and do something
yeah
where is
and and and see that 's another thing
neighborhoods aren't neighborhoods any more
yeah
there 's nobody is next door to you
you do n't know your neighbors and stuff like that
yeah
it 's just huh-uh you know
because i moved out some apartments before because they were loaded with drug dealers
um
and you did n't even
and what the manager the manager wo n't even do anything
he 's probably a drug dealer himself
uh-huh
you never know
you do n't
and so i moved
because i moved the day probably a week after one of the apartments blew up you know
wow
and this is like across the street
this was a nice part of town
um
and there across the street one of the apartments blew up because they were having that making that um crack stuff
um
and then the other time i saw the cops break down somebody 's apartment around the corner
i say see this is it
time to go
that 's it
and i moved
yeah
and you know now i live in like a a neighborhood in a town house
but it 's nice
i do n't you know
yeah
i 'm kind of in the same same kind of deal town house in a neighborhood
but
it 's pretty nice
i do n't know how they can live a neighborhood or apartment complex
that 's what happen that 's what wrong you know
i do n't think do n't rent to them
yeah
or rent to them and evict them because they drug dealers
put it on the lease
yeah
if you deal drugs you ca n't live here
yeah
most of them are too scared to do anything about it
uh-huh
that 's it
yeah
all right
well listen i got to go
all righty
nice talking to you
and i thank you
all right
bye-bye
bye-bye
um
hi
one thing you know that i always think about when i think of public education
cause i went through the public um school system of boston
uh-huh
and uh i always felt that i graduated high school
and i still did n't even i i could n't put together a map of the united state
um
you know what i mean
uh-huh
an yet i felt that i got a good education
and i i did well in school
but you tell me to name you know five continents
an i could n't do it
uh-huh
i just felt like there were some real basics that are missing from education
uh
and the people are are leaving school not even knowing some common sense things
yeah
one
well talking about public education um i 'm we 're doing a proposal
uh-huh
it 's we 're doing it at n c state
yeah
we 're trying to improve the computer science curriculum
uh-huh
so that 's kind of in a higher level
right
so it 's interesting that you chose that topic
yeah
um did you do through a public school system or private
yeah
well i went through private an until ninth grade
uh-huh
did you notice a big difference
oh yeah
a big difference
like in what sense
well um in uh public schools i guess there there are a lot of of you know
people can take lower level courses an get away with learning nothing
uh-huh
but um private school you could n't do that
uh-huh
you had to learn
yeah
i work in a temporary agency
an they 're people that come in you know every day to fill out an application
uh-huh
and they 'll have to bring somebody with them
and they will show that they completed um four year of high school
yet when it comes to even answering the questions on a simple application they ca n't read enough to be able to fill out the answers by themselves
uh
that 's bad
it 's just incredible
yeah
our state cut a whole bunch of a i think it 's ten million dollars out of the school budget
really
so they 're making all kind of cuts
in college people cannot i mean the teachers ca n't make tests any more
and the library canceling all of it 's subscriptions
yeah
it 's pretty sorry
i know
um they uh
i forget
i think it 's um some place in new york because they 're having budget problems they 're closing the libraries
uh-huh
i mean they 're not getting rid of any of the sports or anything like that
uh
they 're not cutting in any other corner
they 're closing the libraries
that to me shows a little uh switch in priorities
yeah
you know
so do you go to college right now
are
yeah
it 's my last year
you 're a so you 're a senior now
yeah
i 'm working on my projects trying to graduate
oh good for you
yeah
that 's great
um is is n c university is that uh state
n c state
what did you say
n c state
n c state
that 's a state university then
yeah
i see
and you 're from there also
well yeah
i was uh i was born in
and then i lived in most of my life
uh-huh
i see
and now i 'm back here going to school
well pretty soon it 's going to get to the point where no one is going to be able to afford to send their kids to college or to do go to college
yeah
it 's just a outrageously expensive
luckily state is one of the cheap ones
oh is it
yeah
well still though
i mean you know thousands of dollars
yeah state 's not that bad
oh well that 's good
yeah
that 's good
i went to a private university
and um i do n't know
i look back now
and i i think that i probably would have done it differently if i um you know could do it over again
yeah
but um i have a lot of friends that went to state schools or did n't even go to school some some of them
and i still feel like they came out knowing just as much as i did
i really do
and that 's probably a pretty sad thing to say
but um
yeah
i do n't know
i i
where did you go
what
where did you go
i went to university
uh-huh
it 's in massachusetts
and um i really felt like i 've been working now for about four years
uh-huh
and i i feel like what i 've learned working is a hundred times more valuable then what learned in school
oh
and i know that i 'm drawing a lot of what i learned in school you know
i i probably just subconsciously rely a lot on on art
but um i do n't know
my sister 's a principal at a school
and one thing she 's trying to instill in kids um besides just reading and writing are just some the golden rules
uh-huh
she calls them just some basics about um you know you do n't take what 's not yours
uh and if you want to you know you do n't touch anybody else unless you have their permission
like no hitting you know
uh-huh
no pulling hair or anything like that
and uh the school that she 's in is a um it 's basically for minorities
um there 's a large minority population
and um she 's really noticed that even some of the teachers that work there
i think they do n't value that type of student as much as you get in some
yeah
that 's sorry
that they that they like pick on the advanced students and pay more attention to them ignore the others
yeah
it 's true
uh-huh
yeah
and i do n't know if it makes them feel better
i mean the do teachers get
i mean personally i would get more satisfaction out of taking someone that wasn't as successful
yeah
and seeing what they could do verses somebody that did excel in in areas and just watching them get better you know
yeah
that 's not much of a challenge
that 's true
but do you have any ideal what you 're going into when you graduate
um graduate school
oh yeah
yeah
do you know where you 're going
i think i 'm going to chappel hill
where 's that
that 's in chappel hill
the
oh is that north carolina
yeah
oh okay
never heard of the uh tarheels
no
i do n't know that area
the a c c tarheels u n c
i know it
oh uh
i do n't get down there very often
they won the final four in boy 's basket ball
oh really
well the way i pick the final four was um by the state that had the warmest climate
uh-huh
so that 's how i chose all mine
so you can tell that i really did n't have that much to do with any of it
but
so obviously you 're into education
yeah
if you can be going
my husband went to is in graduate school actually right now
uh-huh
and uh
i do n't know
i give you a lot of credit
i could n't do it
i i could n't wait to graduate and have it be all over
yeah
i know
oh
i ca n't wait to graduate either now
i know
i 've got all of this stuff due
oh wow
overloaded
yeah
i kind of know what you mean
well it was really nice talking to you
all right
okay
good luck
all right
thank you
all righty
take care
all right
bye
bye-bye
okay
well yes
we do have pollution in houston
and it
how bad is it
do you have smog like they do in california
well it it
some
i think it depends on uh you know what the the cloud cover
and like right now it 's uh it 's kind of overcast you know
just it 's hot
uh-huh
and the sun is trying tries to shine through
but it 's it 's holding in this this pollution
and i
it depends on whether you have some sort of temperature inversion i take it
i think so
and uh
yeah
and we have uh pasadena texas which is sort of between here an you know heading toward galveston
i mean it 's still part of it 's part of the houston metroplex
uh-huh
uh-huh
what do you think is your primary cause of it
well i think it 's industry
and i think it 's cars
you do
you really think cars contribute a lot now that they 've taken lead out of gas
i do n't i
well maybe not
but it it sure it sure
you know it
i i know that when i 'm when i 'm behind a car
and uh sometimes uh i can really smell especially diesel and things like that
uh-huh
you know comes right into my air conditioner
and you know my head and my
i 'm so stopped up right now
um
my goodness
i do n't know if it 's uh if it 's partly from what 's blooming you know right now pollen and stuff like that
that 's part of it
but um
uh-huh
i think a lot of it 's industrial
i also think uh that uh there is a certain amount that comes from automobiles
but it 's mostly from older automobiles
i do n't think the newer automobiles are as polluting uh frankly
uh-huh
i think that uh i think that uh uh
if uh
i i i heard a story a while back
something to the effect that if they could just pay to get twenty percent or take all the cars off the road that have been uh manufactured say before nineteen seventy-five that they could cut the automobile pollution by over fifty percent just by getting rid of those cars that are still left remaining
uh-huh
you mean uh fifty percent pollution total from that comes from
yeah
from from cars
that is not not total but just from cars
okay
oh uh-huh
so that i think would be tremendous help
but i happen to drive an old model car because it 's very economical
and it just keeps getting uh gives me good service
and i do n't have an incentive to get rid of it as long as it keeps running good and not costing me any money
uh-huh
on the other hand i know it 's a much more polluter than any of the newer model cars i have
uh-huh
but i do n't have any incentive to get out of it until it dies
right
and uh that may be part of the problem
do you all have pollution in your part of the country uh from industry
yeah ause
yeah
yeah
oh uh yeah
it 's it 's uh pretty heavy up here i think
but i think it 's mostly industrial is what i really uh believe is the the main problem
and and uh ause
and uh uh people uh i do n't think are paying as close attention to it in this area as they frankly should
i i we we seem to have a high uh cancer rate up here in maryland
really
yeah
and uh
like what
any particular kind or just all kinds
well for instance breast cancer seems to be pretty rampant
and uh i think
of course prostrate cancer 's sort of bad for everybody
but uh this state was like the second
my wife 's a registered nurse
and i think this state was like second this year from the top in terms of uh cancer rate for just all kinds
and i ca n't help but believe that 's not partially caused from pollution
i just do n't know exactly what it necessarily is
but i just ca n't believe it is
um
now we have a lot of pollution being caused by uh fluorocarbons which is the like freon twelve and freon twenty-two
they use freon twenty-two in air conditioning systems in houses and the like and heat pumps
uh-huh
and they use freon twelve in car air conditioners
and that 's also what 's causing our atmosphere to lose it 's ozone layer
uh-huh
and i ca n't help believe if it 's sufficient enough to make the atmosphere lose it 's ozone layer that it 's not acting as a pollutant in our lungs also
and having all kinds of effects
and
well what can we do about the the the the air conditioning problem
well they 're working now
i know dupont and dow and several other chemical companies are working uh feverishly to try to come up with a substitute for fluorocarbons
uh-huh
and who ever does is going to make uh a mint
because if they ever come up with a reasonable working agent in place of fluorocarbons then uh
is that also what 's in uh aerosol
well they used to be
but they made them take it out of that
even so so the aerosol is still aerosol
right
but it does n't have anything that 's damaging
no
they they they passed a law and made them take the fluorocarbons out of the aerosol containers
uh-huh
well that 's good
and that was a move in the right direction
we are doing some things to try to correct the problem
but there are more things we could do
and getting rid of old cars like i said is one way to help correct the problem
uh uh just trying to i think be careful uh with the way you handle garbage
i notice in this state
i do n't know if you 're doing it in texas yet or not
but in this state we have special containers now we have to put all our cans and bottles and plastic pieces uh you know containers in
yeah
here they 've just started started doing that
it 's it 's you know
you 're not you do n't have to
but you know
i know i am
i save
yeah
well we are doing it pretty religiously in our group too
but they uh
in one of the counties here they 're actually doing a trial program of having a trash police
they have a lady that goes around like a meter maid
and she spot checks people 's trash
no kidding
really
oh
and if they find a bottle or a can or anything like that in your trash they 'll fine you fifty bucks i think the first time and two fifty the second time
is that right
well we need to do something
we need to get serious about it
yeah
you
right
you 've got to get people to see
and surprisingly enough just handling of trash uh can cut pollution uh from uh uh from just throwing it in a dump or or or where ever else they used to do with it maybe used to burn it
they 've stopped that up here too
uh-huh
but that that will cut pollution too
because you get a lot of out gassing from these things i think decaying and and trying to
for instance cans and bottles they never go away at all
uh-huh
but on on the other hand i do n't guess they 're polluting
but plastic containers and the like uh they may be
i 'm not sure of that
how much does uh planting more trees and things like that help
oh i think that 's very important to do
too
i i really think that uh trying to get along with your environment and help it out is a very very important thing
uh-huh
and uh that can help to cut pollution i guess some
i i do n't know how much trees actually act as filtering agents in terms of pulling various pollutants or chemicals out of the air
i would hope that they would help some though
that 's for sure
i think uh it seems like there was something going on around here that you know
we have all these chemical plants and oil refineries and those kind of things and that they burn off a lot of stuff
uh-huh
and some of the stuff that they weren't supposed to do that somebody found out you know like in the middle of the night they would go ahead and do it anyway
i think they got caught
oh good
but i wonder how much of that kind of stuff you know goes on
well that uh that i think may go on a lot
and the primary reason i think it may go on a lot is just as you said somebody happened to stay up late at night or something
i do n't think we have a adequate policing uh particularly on industry
uh we have good policing at least in this state and and several of the surrounding states and probably yours too of car pollutants
because we have to go down uh once a year here in maryland and get out car 's exhaust systems checked for emission content
uh we have to uh we have to have a state inspection every year
uh-huh
do you all have that
uh no
we do n't have a state inspection
so
which i
i
i would
but any time you sell a car or buy a car it has to be inspected in this state
so i 'm i 'm assuming that you know they check they check everything for safety
or
i do n't know
uh that 's something that you 'd have to just check with your authorities
but in this state we have to uh pay eight dollars and a half and go to a an emission station once a year and get every one of our cars checked that are have been made starting in nineteen seventy-three
but that 's all they check for
they do n't check how good
if your tires are good enough or your brakes are good enough
no
no
we do n't have inspections like that
now i 'm in maryland
in virginia they check that every two years i think
we do that every year
and i think that 's a good idea too
not not that it necessarily has anything to do with cutting pollution necessarily
but i think it 's a good idea
the emission check though is required in maryland
and it 's also required in virginia uh a sister state to to this one
and that 's that goes a long ways towards cutting pollutants
well i 'll have to check
i 'm not sure if if our state inspection
once a year has to do you know
if they check the uh
uh-huh
well if they do n't i would imagine in time they 'll get a law with get around to it
and if they do n't then that 's something i would certainly uh uh suggest you be willing to uh uh be for in terms of uh
oh i would
yeah
yeah
i 'm for anything that cleans up the air or the water or or or anything
oh yeah
i i agree
now that 's another area we haven't even discussed
and that is water pollution and various of the other types of uh of uh like food pollution
i mean you you hardly ever hear hear anybody say anything about food pollution
but i think there we have a pretty good handle on inspection of foods in this countries
so uh hopefully we 're not ingesting too much in the way of uh pollutants in our food
but water pollution uh
i 've worried especially the last few years about just how good the water supply we have in this country is for drinking and the like
uh-huh
i know a lot more people are going to bottled water
well
and that 's not necessarily the answer either
because they 've found out that that 's just comes out of somebody 's tap
yeah
tap
yeah
so
but a lot of these uh
some of this
well you know a lot of people have well water
in fact in this area too
and an you know
and uh
uh-huh
if you do n't get it tested you do n't necessarily know what you 're what you 're drinking
and i i know a lot of people you know have that
and you know you have to wonder if that you know could have an adverse affect on them too if they do n't they do n't get it checked
yeah
yeah
i 'm absolutely for drinking water out of wells as long as you first of course have it checked
because it seems uh
when i was a kid growing up down south uh i used to go out in the country where my grandparents were
and we had a well
it was one of those draws that
i forget what you call those things
uh-huh
and and that was some of the best tasting water
i mean i can still to this day taste that water
when we were
when i was growing up i lived in huntsville alabama
yeah
and their water supply came from uh spring
uh-huh
and it was like ice cold spring water
and i guess parts of the the city still you know get that
but uh that was that was really wonderful
oh i bet it was
it was really really good
yeah
once it 's been filtered an if it 's a deep enough well filtered through all the earth and everything i think that uh
it depends of course where you are
a good well though i think is very healthy
the latin american situation in
the last development i know of was the military and financial assistance columbia for the for the drug uh control
uh-huh
and i support that fully
i 'm not sure we have the right solution to it
but at least we 're we 're going to the source of the problem
and the source of supply
uh-huh
uh the problem is here
but the source of supply is there
that 's true
very definitely so
in fact i think a lot of the
i 've been to uh peru several times
uh-huh
i 've never been to other parts of south america
but uh i have been to peru
and they need some assistance down there
and i 'm sure that uh as an undeveloped country they look look for it
but there is not exactly a lot of uh physical responsibility there *listen; probably 'fiscal' not 'physical'
no
very immature in that respect
yes
right
and i i think that uh they need guidance and assistance
but they need to learn how to stand on their own own two feet also
i agree
i think that for so long power financially uh governmentally every which way was in the hands of such a few that there 's not the middle class that we we perceive
uh-huh
oh no the and the poor are extremely poor
i know
are extremely poor
that 's correct
i know uh some of the areas in in texas seem poor
but until you 've seen some of those uh native latin americans come down from the hills you ca n't imagine what poor is
uh-huh
and uh the worst scene i 've ever had i think was uh someone eating out of out of a garbage can on the streets in lima peru
and and just very happy to get that
oh yes
yes
i have a brother who spent two years in bolivia
uh-huh
and this is very much his you know reaction that the rich are so rich and the poor are so poor
oh the there 's a joke
the the graft and the uh payoffs down there are are an accepted way
and in a way
uh-huh
uh-huh
and there 's there 's a sad joke
i guess all jokes are really sad
but there 's a joke about the uh ambassador from latin america that came to visit a senator in the u s and was taken to his home for dinner
and the uh home was palatial
they had five or six servants you know and and a lot of expensive uh holdings and all that
and the ambassador said but i know what you make as a u s senator
how can you afford all of this
and he said come i 'll show you
and he walked out in the backyard
and the uh senator said do you see that hospital over there
and the ambassador said yes
and he patted his pocket
and he said fifteen percent
he said you see that school over there
and the ambassador said yes
and he pot patted his pocket and said fifteen percent
so
oh gosh
so the next year the senator went to latin america to visit the ambassador and was treated to dinner in his home
and it was twice as large and four times as many servants
he said well i know how poor your country is
how can you afford this uh in such a poor country
and he he said come i 'll show you
and he walked out the backyard
and he said do you see that hospital over there
and the senator looked
and he could n't see anything
he said no
and the ambassador potted patted his pocket and said one hundred percent
so
yep
yeah
that
it 's a sad story
but
intentions intentions
yes
yes
but it uh it is a problem
i know
uh i have a sister-in-law who is from nicaragua
and her family
her father was a fairly uh high ranking official under somoza
and when that went down the tubes they had to get out
uh-huh
and seventeen children filtered through into into america through guatamala through mexico through honduras
um
you know two here three there one here you know this kind of thing until
yeah
and now uh couple of the older ones stayed or went back
but the rest of them now have their american citizenship and are leading productive lives
uh-huh
but you
well the the other instance i think of their inability to to handle things the cholera and hepatitis epidemics now in in latin america
yes
and it shows the the unpreparedness for such such a problem
yes
and yet they 're so
oh the stories she tells you know are just unnerving just unnerving
yeah
and they 're they 're so rich in resources there
they 're very rich in oil and gas
and they 're very rich in gold and silver and very rich in in uh natural resources such as the fish and uh timber and and copper and all types of uh resources
uh-huh
uh-huh
but they
and the uranium
yes
and
but they do n't have
it 's sort of like russia
they do n't have the ability to develop it
the technology
right
and they they 're very
well
and you know they 're very willing to be taught in many cases now too
but you know there 's just always this kind of resentment underlying
i think that when they receive help from us they want it
but they do n't want it i mean
you 're you 're exactly right
it 's kind of a catch twenty-two
uh-huh
it it 's sort of illustrated by the uh world bank and international monetary fund not wanting to continue to do business there
because they offer assistance then do n't get repaid
yeah
yeah
so it 's sort of a thumbing of the nose uh approach
they need it
and they need to live up to certain regulations and expectations
but uh then do n't
of course it 's a very volatile government uh situation too
well
and i think that you know it
somewhat a sarcastic view
but some of those drugs czars you know
they they know that by pumping that poison into our system that that 's the way to bring us to our knees more on their level
uh-huh
you know
you know that 's really uh kind of a far fetched idea
i know
and i do n't think people probably think those things consciously
uh-huh
but it 's like in any sibling rivalry
well the
we 're hearing the same
the solution discussed at one time and i think it has real merit on the drug situation is that the the u s government could spend less money by buying the crop and destroying it than they are in trying to to beef up the military and to do all other things
i think it would be cheaper to buy it and destroy it
which would still give the uh the grower in columbia and elsewhere in latin america the uh the money that they apparently need and go go to the illegal crop for
and it would save the u s money in in the long run in how much they 're trying to do
in the long run
and in the short run probably too
true
course then could you know at at some point could you ever convince someone to turn around and grow something that was productive for humankind
no
no
you know
and i i think finding an alternate to that would be very good
i mean even their even their legal crops are things that we do n't perceive as being healthy now from a medical standpoint of view coffee tobacco you know
right
uh-huh
argentine beef
yeah
yeah
they 're certainly legal
but they 're certainly not healthy
well have we come up with a solution yet salina
no
not that i know of
but it 's been fun hashing about it i suppose
at any rate
yeah
yeah
yeah
well one of these days uh i hope we 'll find some some way to substitute the good crops for illegal ones
well let 's just hope that the powers that be uh have time to a little bit once in a while to to think in some farther reaching avenues than you and i do here tonight
but
i agree
well it 's been nice chatting with you
yes
it has
i appreciate it
and and tell your wife i hope we i get her again sometime too
this is fun
very good
it 's kind of nice to to see old friends now you see
all right
thank you salina
bye now
bye
gun control seems to be a rather uh timely topic with all that 's going on legislation wise
yes
and uh the the interesting scale that they assigned it uh the one being a banned and ten being no regulations or totally free
i 'd have to put myself pretty much in the middle i guess
i i do n't mind regulating all of the the guns
and i would certainly call for a ban on certain types
now the the wisdom as to which types that 's going to be a debate forever i would assume
uh the method of of controlling it well that 's all into how much money you want to put into the the controls
uh one point that was made in the house hearings
or
the representative stood up and said you know we can check a guy 's credit card instantly
but uh we do n't want to check his background
and of course those are two different issues as far as privacy goes
right
uh
but there still the the technology exists to to check it if they want
so it 's it 's kind of a
i guess you could put a dollar figure on it if you really want to make that kind of an effort and regulate it like that
and then you 've got the group of people that decide that there 's there 's no particular reason to have them at all
and you got to balance those against the ones that say there is some sport to it
and i guess i would fall more in the the realm that i like the sport issue of it
but i i could give it up without too much trouble
not the world 's most pleasurable thing
and it costs a bit to do it uh finding ranges and things like that
yes
right
uh i have shot a variety of guns for a number of years
but it 's just not like golf or whatever
i mean there are other things that you could go do
so uh i i do n't see the the joy of shooting as as that much of a driving factor
i think that society could easily swing the scales the other direction just for the sake of safety of the number of kids that tend to get hurt
yeah
i do n't even keep the gun in our house
right
so i do n't have that problem
but uh
it 's a hard hard topic i guess
a lot of people have a hard issue a lot of hard feelings about it
they do
and you boy you can get them on either side
and just like you say
uh well i think i i guess i 'd have to place myself uh probably seven or eight
because
or not
onto no control
i 'm sorry excuse me that
uh two or three
uh-huh
i was going the wrong direction
uh because of we had a neighbor child that was killed by another child because they had a gun in the house
and the father kept the bullets in a separate place
but the little boy was five years old and was intelligent enough to
uh he knew where booth both places were loaded the gun
and they were playing cowboys and indians
and he shot the other little boy right between the eyes
so uh
i mean it
it destroyed two families uh in just that instant
right
and and i a lot of people say that they need it for protection uh
having worked at one time in baltimore
or
i do n't know if you 're in the big city
dallas
are you
dallas
uh-huh
that 's a big city
yeah
uh then you know that uh uh
if you live anywhere real close that uh
the safety is uh
some people argue that they need a gun to make sure that they aren't going to get shot because of the incidences of break ins and you know
but uh uh we have never had a gun in the house with my children growing up
uh i uh
once uh uh knew a fellow that had had been a policeman
and he said that if you pull a gun on a robber he 's going to assume that you know how to use it well
and he 's going to you know try to shoot first
right
uh so you know if he 's got one
uh and if not
uh then usually they uh
if he 's got a knife or whatever that can throw it at you
i mean you know they they
right
he said that it it was better not to have
especially myself now i 'm a widow
and uh
i so i 'm when my handicapped son is is not at home i 'm by myself
but uh there 's
i still wo n't have a gun in the house because he said it 's really uh playing russian roulette if you do
uh
yeah
about the only circumstances that they 'd be of any value is when you happen to already know that the the person was coming your way
once you 're surprised it 's too late
that 's right
and and the rare
that 's right
you know the very few of those burglaries actually occur in such a way that you knew the guy was coming
right
and had time to do anything about it
that 's right
and i do n't have that problem
as i do n't use that argument as saying it 's worth keeping one
in the uh n r as uh claim that the uh the constitutional the right to bear arms and that whole statement uh
it 's hard to know the original intent
but i i do n't see it as that that difficult of a story to believe when the opposition says that uh yeah it 's the right to to arm a militia and as opposed to just the general public
right
and you have a you have a earn a right
not just a privilege as it were if you 're going to serve in the militia
then you have a right to have that arm
but uh
that 's right
you know there 's all sorts of arguments there
i know
but i do n't even want to worry about what the original intent was
no
they did n't have this problem back then
no
that 's true
that that 's that 's right
so we change our rights with our social status
that 's right
they 're man given rights
and they can be taken away by a man
so
right
uh the people that hide behind that i do n't worry about
they can go live in another country if they want
well yeah
that 's how i feel too
i know well
even here where i work uh we have a a gun club
and of course those people are very avid
they you know they say there should be no ban
uh-huh
that it 's not
but i ca n't see why any uh on the street citizen should be able to be allowed to have a machine gun
right
uh you know when you were talking about maybe what kind of guns that would be hard to decide
but there are a few guns that uh just are not uh sport
or i mean
i do n't know too many people that use a machine gun to go sport hunting either
right
so uh i i think they should have at least some control over over those things
uh and when you were speaking about how they can check up you know on credit cards
well i i understand about the privacy act and everything
but why ca n't they check to see if the person who is applying for this gun has had a record or not
that to me would not be an unreasonable thing
right
and if they do
course the argument with the people in the gun club uh is that uh well the people that are going to get guns are the ones that are going to steal them anyway
right
and so it 's not going to be that they 're buying them
course some of them do
yeah
so it it is a hard question
tends to tends to strap only the legitimate people
most regulation does
right
oh yeah
and most
it 's very difficult to uh legislate uh crooks or whatever you want however you want to word it
that 's right
so it 's
well this may be a never ending topic
i got a couple of calls waiting on me
so i 'd better let you go
okay
well thanks for talking
okay bye
bye-bye now
night
fine
thank you
i understand we 're supposed to talk about spaceflight
yes
i hope you know more about it than i do
oh well i just got through renting reading uh space by uh james michener
oh is that right
and so that uh helped out a little bit i think
i haven't read his book
i was so upset with texas that i haven't gotten into any more of his books because i thought it was just horrible
well he tends to go into a lot of detail sometimes
well
and i do n't think he was truthful in a lot of what he did in texas
so i wasn't sure how credible he was
oh is that right
but anyway what do you think we 've gained from the spaceflights
well uh i 'm not sure to be honest with you
so uh this going to the moon seemed to be a exciting adventure
and uh and yeah
ego trip
it was nice to go there
but i do n't know that it really benefitted mankind that much
uh-huh
i happen to live not too far away from
uh well i 've actually worked for the company that uh has been blamed for the challenger disaster uh morton thiakol
oh is that right
uh-huh
and uh you know that 's been kind of a a real negative feeling here
is
right
sure it was you know very unfortunate thing that occurred there
and it 's
where do you live
uh we live in uh utah
you live in
am i talking to utah right now
uh-huh
oh oh great
yeah
because i 'm in dallas
uh
oh
i have a sister that lives in dallas
that 's how we got hooked up to the program was her her husband works for penney 's there
i see
i see
so
carolyn rash
pardon me
is her name rash carolyn rash
no her name is uh my last name is skidmore
i see
and her her husband 's name is his last name is weight
i see
and uh
well you probably know a lot about it
i wasn't sure that they were blaming that space disaster on one company
i hadn't heard that
well they were
there was uh
apparently the specifications for the joints uh
they were not to perform in uh cold weather
and uh apparently there was definitely a a joint that did not seal
and uh if you 've ever seen the size of those uh motors that put them into space
uh-huh
i mean they 're as long as a football field practically and about twelve foot in diameter
uh-huh
and and there is a lot of pressure lot of thrust to get that much weight up in the air
oh yeah
so it 's this book was interesting though
i uh
talked about how a lot of the problems they have to come overcome to uh
it 's a very complex uh situation to go into space
oh yeah
i would think so too
they would
the thing that he went into quite a bit of detail about how how much of a problem it is to re-enter the earth 's atmosphere
you never think about that do you
yeah
i would think it would be harder to get up than it would be getting back down
yeah
but they have to come in at a just the right angle
if you come in at the wrong angle what happens is they bounce off and go back into space
uh-huh
and if they come into it at a different angle there is so much friction that it burns them up
right
so
well i saw one of some of those early space capsules at smithsonian
i 'm sure you 've seen more of them than i have
oh
but you could see the scorch on them you know
uh-huh
they had though piles
yeah
but you could see where they would come off in the how hot it got because it was still the scorch on them which was quite interesting
yeah
i 've i 've i would say i 've never i 've never seen an actual capsule
well i
excuse me go ahead
oh yeah
i 've seen more more of the motors that that they produced out there
uh-huh
well these were the ones that john glenn went up in you know and the old old ones
uh-huh
yeah
the very first ones
the little bell type things
people have commented how uh they were surprised at how small they were
yeah
they really were
they just uh
looked pretty confining huh
oh yeah
and uh the whole thing was small
and yeah you i mean you actually put it on you know
is that right
you put it around you pretty much
it was so small
huh
well i thought there was some medical benefits that we have learned from space
but did he go into that in the book
not really uh
i guess that 's just to sell us on it
one thing 's
i know one thing they 've they 've mentioned that i did n't get from the book by the way
but it talked about uh
they 're able to manufacture uh different kinds of crystals and ball bearings and things like that in a zero gravity state that they turned out being almost uh nearly perfect as far as a ball bearing goes
oh yeah
it 's perfectly round
uh-huh
but i 'm not sure you have to go to outer space to achieve that zero gravity
well that 's true
and
yeah
that 's right
well do you think we should continue to support it at the level
well i thought probably one of the things they were doing that they did n't tell us was spying
because i think those satellites you know or not satellites but the spaceflights could really spy
uh-huh
and with uh with russia 's demise i did n't know if we should continue to support it at the current level
yes
uh i think they have cut it back to be honest with you from from the glory days when they did the apollo shots to the moon
yeah
uh
uh i appreciate having the satellites
you know that 's certainly made it nice for other purpose
i do n't know if you have a satellite dish or not
we do n't
no
i do n't
i do n't either
but i i know that 's certainly helped a lot in that regard uh
yeah
well the topic 's about government
uh i 'm not altogether sure that that 's my best topic uh
i thought it was kind of a strange topic about corruption in the government and uh how many people are self serving
yeah
uh-huh
i mean you i i think people tend to think that the government is not corrupt and that people aren't self serving
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
i mean that 's what i would like to think
yeah
i i i think that the last uh part of that question was particularly interesting uh about uh uh uh can all unethical behavior or how much unethical behavior can be made illegal uh because it seems to me that when uh government or public service of any kind degenerates so much that you have to have so many explicit ethical codes uh parallel to the legal codes that uh we 're focusing on the wrong thing
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
maybe maybe that 's what is happening
maybe so many things have become public with the media over the past you know ten to twenty years that uh it becomes more evident
perhaps things that we did n't think of before and just concentrated on the lawmaking or the results that would be seen in public works or bills that are passed or you know et cetera like that
uh-huh
and we were just not exposed to the personal lives of these persons
uh-huh
and i could n't help thinking when that last it was a funny question when that last part of the question came about how many things can we uh actually put a legal code on that uh how much uh should it be our uh prerogative to see into the private lives of these people you know
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
that makes sense
um
because you start prying in people 's private lives you ruin their lives as well as
that 's right
and sometimes you know i do n't even know how much of a difference it really makes you know
yeah
i mean i guess in some cases sure we care about what they did in the past
uh-huh
but uh sometimes i do n't know
uh-huh
i think it gets in the way of the better judgment
i mean just because you did something in the past does n't mean he 's not a good enough person to be a politician
i i i agree with that and uh and also that if the results that they 're putting out and what they actually seem to be accomplishing by legitimate means is what 's you know going to the public then uh then they 'll pay for their private life in their own private conscience
uh-huh
uh-huh
that 's it
and uh you when it becomes public though it becomes scandalous
uh-huh
yeah
the that 's that 's the thing that
uh things that you do n't know uh do do not worm their way around and influence other people or perhaps lead other people astray
uh-huh
yeah
people could say oh they do it
so i guess you know
but as soon as things do get public uh there there is that terrible concern
uh-huh
um
so sometimes i ask myself what are uh people doing that are in the media when somebody you know comes up to office
uh-huh
it seems that one of the first thing that 's done is to dig up any kind of a thing they can on them and get it all over the headlines
uh-huh
oh yeah
i guess it 's what sells newspapers you know
it 's a very low way of living
uh-huh
uh so
and and and as far as uh you know myself having any particular personal uh knowledge or insight into politics or politicians it i 'm not terribly involved in it
uh-huh
just in a very cursory way
right
i vote
and i you know try to do whatever i can on the little local area
but i i it just is not one of the things that i have uh placed uh uh a a lot of my particular time and effort into
yeah
so i i always feel very outside this kind of uh this kind of an issue
uh-huh
yeah
but uh
i am kind of the same way
i just kind of read the paper follow up on i mean you know just keep an eye on what 's going on
yeah
uh-huh
yeah
right
but i do n't really play an active role in any kind of politics
yeah
uh
uh uh-huh
i 'm not i 'm not in there
i 'm not one of those uh you know volunteers that 's down at headquarters and whatever uh although i admire the people that do that
and they certainly do get inside information
uh-huh
and uh of course the better you know a person that might be affiliated with that kind of thing the more you can trust their their judgment and their insight
right
right
uh-huh
but the media insight as you said
i just kind of read and kind of be aware
yeah
and then uh i do n't like to make a whole lot of uh judgment myself unless things are so absolutely out of whack that uh
yeah
all right
well do you play any musical instruments or
no
i do n't play any
i used to
oh well
i think everybody took piano lessons
so
everybody
sure
i i started when i was in uh third grade
and i 've i still play the piano as of today
do you
yes
i do
i started
i think i was in the fifth grade
and i played it for maybe three months
but then again i was also in uh the marching band
i played the drums
i played the clarinet
i played the trumpet
wow
uh you know whatever
and so i i still sing
and i sing in the choir today
so
all right
i i enjoy the music
it gives me an out
yeah
it always sounds like
for my playing the piano when i was depressed and did n't have anything else to do and there was no one to play with i could always go play with the piano you know
true
so how long did you play
only for about three months
three months
yeah
me and my brother both took the classes
and we got pretty bored quick
i was going to say you got as far as the uh chop sticks huh
um well i could play uh the wood chuck song
oh the wood chuck song
and i still can to this date
and your mother 's saying and although the money that we spent for those piano lessons this is all we got was the wood chuck song
yeah
yep
they went out and bought us a piano
and for three months
oh bless your heart
did you ever did you ever just bang on it or do anything with it at all
oh yeah
any time i got bored
oh okay
but i mean can you play anything on it other than wood chuck song
no
no
and jaws
but i think everybody can
okay
i i i can still read music if i 'm lucky
because i
if i work real hard i can still barely read the music
but see i played the piano from the third grade all the way through high school
yeah
so
yeah
i played uh concertos and other stuff
but
i got to the point where i wasn't really reading music i was memorizing music
so because of that i ca n't read music as well as i used to
but anyway
yeah
but i enjoy it though
i find it to be a good out
and i still enjoy the marching band
and i still enjoy uh singing in the choir
so
do you sing at choir at your church
yes
i do
yeah
yes
i do
that 's
in fact that 's about the only musical thing that i still do is sing in the choir
yeah
i tried out for choir when i was think in the seventh grade
and they would n't let me in
so i never tried again
well i sing in the choir
i do know if they want me to or not
but at least i do sing in it
yeah
that 's pretty good
well
i never really learned the music or anything
i never learned
i got right to where i was figuring out where all the keys were on the piano
and that 's about when i quit
i was at
i actually went to the university of texas at one time thinking that i would be a musician
i wanted to be a high school band director
yeah
but after one semester of that i said no no
this isn't for me
enjoy it but not for profession no
yeah
and besides that i kind of learned i wasn't really that good
i gave up
yeah
course my mom thought i was
but uh you know
of course
parents always do
oh yeah
so
they 're nice that way
yes
well what else can we uh talk about
uh
uh well i do n't
so you listen to kind of church music gospel
no
no
i i listen to k v i l
oh yeah
yeah
yeah
so i listen to the radio
i like the pop music
oh yeah
i like people like neil diamond and all all the folks that you 're not supposed to like
but that 's who i go for
oh yeah
the jeezer music as i call it
oh the jeezer music
yeah
oh okay
well
my boss listens to that
we listen to ninety-seven point nine
and that 's his station so i call it the jeezer music
okay
now what kind of music do you listen to
well i listen to like ninety-seven point one you know more
what what is that
it 's more uh
i do n't know how to explain it
kind of pop you know rock
rock
yeah
hard rock
well not hard
not hard rock
just kind of
not like the eagle
huh
is that the eagle
yeah
okay
i know i know what the eagle is
it 's not too hard
it 's
that 's not too hard
you know
but it 's not enough to put you to sleep
true
true
which some of the songs on k v i l can
well course see i listen to k v i l for the contests
i mean
oh yeah
got the bumper sticker too
oh yes
oh yes
you ca n't drive a car without bumper sticker
and you know they 're going to call you up
someday
yeah
well listen i 've enjoyed talking
i i 'm sure that the switchboard will probably give us that sign off message very shortly anyway
okay
