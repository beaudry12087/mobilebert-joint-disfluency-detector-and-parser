um _ all _ right _
i _ 've _ uh _
as _ far _ as _ i _ 'm _ concerned _ i _ find _ that _ the _ young _ women _ have _ lost _ so _ much _ because _ they _ have _ become _ more _ aggressive _ and _ more _ dominating _
and _ i _ think _ that _ comes _ about _ from _ their E being _ a _ definite _ factor _ in _ the _ job _ market _ now _
uh-huh _
oh E well E i E tend E i _ tend _ to _ agree _
uh E in _ some _ ways _ i E think E it E 's E uh E i _ think _ if _ anything _ a _ lot _ of _ um E the _ changes _ that _ have _ occurred _ uh E
in _ some _ ways _ they _ 're _ for _ the _ better _
because _ i _ think _ women _ should _ have _ a _ choice _
and _ i _ do _ believe _ in E the E being _ able _ to _ have _ a _ choice _ as _ to _ as _ far _ as _ what _ you _ would _ like _ to _ do _ with _ your _ life _
but _ by _ the _ same _ token _ and _ i _ know _ this _ for _ myself _ because _ i _ 've _ worked _ and _ i _ 've _ not _ worked _ um _
that E it _ makes _ it _ uh E sometimes _ it _ makes _ life _ more _ difficult _
i _ think _ when _ the _ roles _ now _ are _ less _ defined _ as _ far _ as _ you _ know _ what _ uh E women _ should _ or _ should _ not _ be _ doing _ that _ it E it _ it _ could _ make _ life _ more _ difficult _
there _ are _ more _ things _ to _ work _ out _
i _ know _ when _ i _ was _ working _ you _ know _ you _ have _ all _ these _ problems _ with E with _ the _ child _ care _ and E and _ with _ uh E pleasing E you _ know _ your _ boss _ on _ the _ job _
so _ you _ have _ added _ stresses _ from _ there _
and _ then _ you _ still _ have _ all _ the _ things _ that E um E that _ you _ need _ to _ do _ at _ home _
and _ that _ does _ n't _ change _ you _ know _
just _ because _ your _ going _ out _ of _ the _ house _ for _ so _ many _ hours _ a _ day _ does _ n't _ uh _ make _ those _ other _ things _ go _ away _
and _ the _ other _ responsibilities _ are _ still _ important _
um _
so _ um E have E you E have _ you _ worked _ outside _ also _ and _ um E feel _ that E it E that _
well _ how _ do _ you _ feel _ as _ far _ as _ uh _
what _ would _ be _ a _ happy _ medium _
or E or _ what _ would _ you _ like _ to _ see _
i _ would _ like _ uh _
yes _
i _ have _ worked _ outside _ of _ the _ home _
and _ i _ was _ in _ one _ of _ those _ safe _ occupations _
yes _
i _ was _ a _ school _ teacher _
uh-huh _
and _ we _ had _ one _ child _ when _ i _ taught _ for _ my _ two _ year _ career _
uh-huh _
uh _ we _
uh _ then _ i _ stopped _ teaching _ after _ my _ husband _ 's _ business _ was _ established _
and _ we _ had _ two _ children _
and _ i _ stayed _ home _ with _ those _ children _ and _ raised _ those _ children _
yes _
and _ now _ that _ my _ husband _ has _ retired _ i _ am _ back _ substitute _ teaching _
yes _
which _ if _ anyone _ has _ ever _ been _ involved _ in _ that _ some _ days _ it _ 's _ fun _
and _ some _ days _ you _ wonder _ why _ you _ 're _ even _ bothering _
right _
because _ your _ fighting _ for _ your _ life _
but _
yeah _
but _ i _ am _ a _ fighter _
and _ i _ 've _ always _ been _ a _ disciplinarian _
uh E i E 'm E i _ 'm _ not _ real _ sure _ that _ the _ young _ girls _ of _ today _ are _ being _ forced _ into _ the _ job _ market _ as _ many _ of _ them _ imply _
i _ think _ they _ 're _ going _ in _ by _ choice _
oh _ i _ think _ so _
yes _
yes _
and E and _ i _ have _ no _ problem _ with _ that _
but _ i _ think _ the _ male _ needs _ to _ be _ the _ dominant _ person _
and _ i _ think _ too _ many _ of _ the _ young _ professional _ wives _ in _ our _ small _ town _ of _ five _ thousand _ uh _ are _ not _ letting _ that _ happen _
uh-huh _
they _ are _ very _ aggressive _
uh-huh _
they E 're E uh E they _ almost _ have _ what _ i _ would _ call _ a _ killer E killer _ bee _ instinct _
yeah _
and _ they _ have _ to _ be _ in _ charge _
and E and _ i E i _ think _ they _ lose _ a _ lot _ by _ what _ i _ call _ neutering _ their _ husbands _
uh-huh _
children _ well _ what _ do _ you _ think _ ater _ running _
though _ um _ um _
i _ do _ n't _ know _
i _
the E the _ one _ problem _ i _ guess _ i _ have _
and _ maybe _ what _ so _ many _ women _ younger _ women _ now _ are _ choosing _ to _ go _ outside _ is _
i _ feel _ that _ in _ general _ in _ this _ society _ that _ being _ at _ home _ is _ not _ looked _ upon _ as _ um _ a _ job _ in _ itself _
whereas _ you _ know _ you _ hear _ a _ lot _ of _ women _ that _ are _ home _ saying _ that _ it _ is _ a _ job _ in _ itself _
but _ i _ know _ when _ i _ was _ working _
and _ i _ was _ an _ engineer _ so _ i _ was _ always _ with _ men _
uh _ and _ they _ were _ single _ many _ of _ them _
and _ i _ tried _ to _ explain _ to _ them _ well _ my _ day _ does _ n't _ end _ when _ i _ leave _ at _
i E used E to E leave E at E three E i _ keep _ going _ to _ eleven _ at _ night _
uh-huh _
and _ they E had E they _ used _ to _ look _ down _ on _ women _ that _ were _ home _
they _ 'd _ say _ oh _ i _ bet _ you _ go _ home _ and _
you _ know _ at _ least _ you _ get _ out _ of _ here _ at _ three _
and _ you _ can _ go _ home _ and _ put _ your _ feet _ up _ and _ watch _ soap _ operas _
and _ i _ used _ to _ be _ infuriated _
uh-huh _
because _ they _ really _ had _ no _ idea _ what _ was _ involved _ once _ i _ got _ home _
now _ taking _ care _ of _ them _ running _ them _ everywhere _ helping _ with _ homework _ the _ bath _ the _ whole _ you _ know _ everything _
um _ and _ i _ think _ that _ one _ reason _ that _ so _ many _ younger _ women _ feel _ compelled _ to _ go _ into _ a _ profession _ is _ that _ they _ feel _ that _ if _ they _ stay _ home _ they _ are _ not _ respected _ and _ that _ being _ home _ is _ not _ a _ respectable _ uh _ position _ in _ society _
huh _
and _ there _ 's _ a _ lot _ of _ truth _ to _ that _
and _ i _ do _ n't _ know _ how _ you _ feel _
i _ do _ n't _ know _ how _ you _ felt _ when _ you _ were _ home _ and _ what _ kind _ of _ feedback _ you _ got _
but _ i _ can _ see _ with _ the _ younger _ men _ that _ they _ definitely _ are _ looking _ down _ upon _ women _ that _ are _ home _
and _ yet _ by _ the _ same _ token _ i _ think _ some _ of _ it _ is _ jealousy _
you E you _
once _ in _ a _ while _ you _ hear _ them _ say _ things _ like _ i _ wish _ i _ had _ the _ choice _ you _ know _
uh-huh _
i _ wish _ i _ was _ the _ one _
i _ would _ stay _ home _ with _ my _ kids _ if _ my _ wife _ would _ go _ out _ and _ support _ us _
if _ my _ wife _ had _ an _ education _ and _ could _ support _ us _
and _ the _ only _ value _ i _ see _ coming _ out _ of _ this _ is _ that _ children _ now _ in E in _ a _ two _ parent _ home _ they _ now _ actually _ have _ two _ parents _
yeah _
because _ i _ see _ my _ sons-in-law _
i _ have _ a _ daughter _ who _ 's _ a _ nurse _
and _ i _ have _ a _ daughter _ who _ 's _ a _ beautician _
right _
and _ i _ see _ my _ sons-in-law _ cooking _ and _ dropping _ children _ off _ at _ the _ sitter _ and _ picking _ children _ up _ from _ school _ and E and _ having _ a _ much _ better _ relationship _ with _ their _ children _ than _ my _ husband _ ever _ did _
uh-huh _
right _
right _
uh-huh _
that _ 's _ true _
because _ he _ left _ home _ at _ five _ thirty _ in _ the _ morning _
that _ 's _ true _
and _ he _ got _ home _ at _ six _ fifteen _
yes _
and _ uh _ he _ ate _ his _ dinner _
and _ he _ was _ asleep _ in _ his _ chair _ because _ he _ was _ exhausted _
right _
so _ now _ the _ young _ fathers _ are _ having _ a _ chance _ to _ parent _
and _ i _ think _ that _ 's _ an _ advantage _
and _ they _ enjoy _ it _
yeah _
and _ they _ do _ enjoy _ it _
i E i _ see _
uh-huh _
you _ 're _ right _
i _ see _ many _ more _ men _ in _ the _ supermarket _ in _ the _ parks _ with _ their _ children _
uh-huh _
uh-huh _
and _ i _ think _ that _ is _ healthy _ because _
and _ i _ think _ it _ 's _ a E a _ wonderful _ advantage _ for E the E young E for E the E for _ the _ particularly _ for _ the _ males _ for _ the _ little _ boys _ to _ have _ a _ relationship _ with _ their _ father _
right _
oh _ yeah _
and E and _ i _ do _ n't _ think _ you E we _ get _ into _ so _ much _ of _ the _ mother _ dominating _ figure _ if E if _ the _ father _ has _ more _ input _ there _
yes _
yeah _
but _ uh _ i _ do _ n't _ understand _ why _ the _ young _ girls _ feel _ like _ they _ have _ to _ build _ roads _
and _ they _ have _ to E that _ kind _ of _ job _ uh E to _ go _ out _ there _ and _ shovel _ that _ tar _ and E and _ drive _ those _ big _ trucks _
and _ we _ just _ recently _ finished _ a _ long _ drive _ through _ the _ west _ a _ little _ over _ five _ thousand _ miles _
uh-huh _
and _ at _ one _ point _ we _ sat _ down _ uh _
i _ did _ n't _ realize _ it _
but _ i _ sat _ at _ a _ counter _ to _ have _ a _ cup _ of _ coffee _ that _ happened _ to _ be _ for _ truck _ drivers _ only _
uh-huh _
and _ here _ 's _ this _ young _ girl _ with _ the _ tattoos _
and _ she _ has _ just _ had _ just _ driven _ a _ load _ of _ meat _ from _ minneapolis _ to _ some _ place _ in _ arizona _
uh-huh _
and _ she _ 'd _ been _
and _ i _ ask _ her _ how _ old _ she _ was _
and _ she _ was _ the E between _ the _ age _ of _ our _ daughters _
and _ she _ had _ been _ driving _ a _ truck _ for _ seven _ years _
uh-huh _
and _ i _ thought _ gosh _
i _ mean _ why _ would _ a _ woman _ choose _ that _ rough _ and _ tumble _ life-style _ when _
yeah _
i _ guess _ i E 'm E i _ 'm _ maybe _ victorian _
and _ my _ husband _ is _ a _ little _ bit _ of _ a _ male _ chauvinist _
in _ that _ he _ 's _ a _ very _ considerate _ person _
but _ he _ also _ thinks _ a _ woman _ should _ be _ taken _ care _ of _ and E and _ in _ the _ home _
and _ she _ should _ vote _
but _ after _ she _ talks _ to _ her _ husband _ about _ how _ she _ ought _ to _ vote _
now _ it _ probably _ does _ n't _ work _ that _ way _ in _ our _ household _ because _ i _ have _ strong _ opinions _ about _ things _ too _
yeah _
but _ uh _ i _ like _ being _ taken _ care _ of _
i _ like _ my _ luggage _ carried _ and _ my _ door _ opened _
well _
and _ i _ think _ the _ young _ women _ are _ losing _ that _
and _ i _ think _ that _ 's _ sad _
well E that E that _ 's _ true _
there _ is _ that _ part _ too _
and _ i _ guess _ we _ also _ have _ to _ examine _ though _
and _ although _ your _ husband _ 's _ probably _ been _ as _ much _ conditioned _ as _ you _ know _ anybody _ else _
he _ was _ raised _ in _ the _ south _
um _
i _ think _ that _ 's _ a _ little _ condition _
i _ guess _ ha- _
both _
oh _ oh _ yeah _
and E and _ you E have E to E i _ guess _ you _ have _ to _ question _ too _ why _ a _ lot _ of _ the _ men _ especially _ i _ think _ middle _ age _ and _ older _ men _ why _ they _ feel _ that _ way _
and E and _ i _ think _ it _ gets _ scary _ for _ them _ to _ see _ change _ also _
they _ 've _ been _ used _ to _ being E really _ to _ be _ honest _ in E in _ society _ and _ in _ a _ way _ number _ one _
and _ they _ come _ home _
and _ everything _ 's _ done _ for _ them _
uh-huh _
huh _
and _ their _ meal _ is _ served _
and _ i _ think _ it _ 's _ frightening _ to _ them _ to _ see _ the _ roles _ switching _
sure _
and _ i E think E i _ think _ this _ reaction _ comes _ more _ out _ of _ fear _
now E my _ husband _ is E um E he _ 's _ ten _ years _ older _ than _ me _
and _
but _ he E has E his _ attitudes _ are _ very _ much _ pro-women _ pro-career _ which _ is _ kind _ of _ interesting _
uh-huh _
he _ comes _ from _ a _ culture _ where _ women _ are E stay _ at _ home _ and _ do _ everything _
uh-huh _
um _ and _ yet _ um _ he _ 's _ the _ type _ that _ he _ is _ willing _ to _ have _ to _ take _ on _ more _ responsibility _ um _ if _ that _ meant _ oor _ you _ know _ for _ me _ to _ be _ able _ to _ uh _ uh _ advance _ or _ go _ back _ to _ work _ or _ whatever _
i _ 'm _ kind _ of _ more _
alking _ to _ someone _ in _ background _ thank _ you _ esumes _ talking _ to _ speaker _ a _
i _ 'm _ kind _ of _ more _ middle _ of _ the _ road _
i _ think _ that _ when _ children _ are _ small _ i _ think _ it _ 's _ okay _ for _ women _ to _ work _ especially _
there _ should _ be _ some _ a _ lot _ more _ part _ time _
but _ i _ think _ it _ 's _ um _
i _ do _ n't _ believe _ in _ this E career E you _ know _ this _ career _ drive _ when E when _ they _ 're _ small _ because _ i _ think _
uh-huh _
alking _ to _ someone _ in _ background _ they _ 're _ downstairs _ esumes _ talking _ to _ a _
i _ think _ that _ 's _ very _ um E unfair _ to E to _ children _
like _ uh _ engineers _ usually _ work _ fifty _ or _ sixty _ hours _ a _ week _
uh-huh _
huh _
huh _
i _ refused _ to _ work _ more _ than _ thirty _
uh-huh _
i _ was _ part-time _
and _ even _ that _ was _ a _ rat _ race _
huh _
but _ i _ think _ you _ have _ to _ put _ in _ perspective _ that _ you _ know _ when _ the _ kids _ came _ home _ from _ school _ i _ wanted _ to _ be _ here _
i E did E n't E want E i _ do _ n't _ want _ a _ job _ where _ i _ 'm _ traveling _ around _ and _ i _ 'm _ away _ and _ uh E
so _ i _ think _ you _ can _ have _ both _
it _ 's _ more _ hectic _
but _ i _ think _ you _ have _ to _ put _ into _ perspective _ what _ your _ kids _ need _ first _ then _
i _ think _ a _ lot _ of _ my _ problem _ with _ the _ young _ mothers _
talk _ about _ the _ activities _ that _ we _ do _ n't _ do _
yeah _
i E i _ do _ n't _ have _ any _ children _
so _
but _ i E i _ have _ a _ lot _ of _ friends _ with _ children _
and _ i _ know _ they _ spend _ a _ lot _ of _ time _ with _ them _
which _ is _ good _ you _ know _
that _ 's _ good _ to _ hear _
yeah _
an _ i _ have _ n't _ uh _
well E i _ 've _ been _ around _ a _ lot _ of _ people _ lately _ at E at _ my _ job _ that _ do _ n't _ have _ a _ lot _ of _ values _
so _ it E 's E it _ 's _ always _ nice _ to _ see _ people _ that _ like _ each _ other _
and _ like _ families _ that _ get _ along _ with _ each _ other _ and _ like _ to _ do _ things _ together _
yeah _
have _ a _ lot _ of _ values _
i _ love _ that _
do _ they _ have _ children _
uh E the E one E the _ most _ valueless _ girl _ does _ n't _
but _ she _ 's _ married _
and _ i E i _ 'm _ not _ quite _ sure _ why _
i E i _ think _ he _ said _ that _ he _ 'd _ give _ her _ a _ big _ ring _ and _ she _ got _ married _ to _ him _
oh _ that _ 's _ wonderful _
but _ it E it _ 's _ kind _ of _ weighed _ on _ me _
and _ then _ the _ other _ day _ my _ husband _ and _ i _ met _ a _ couple _ who E who _
they _ 're _ just _ going _ to _ have _ their _ first _ child _
and _ they _ really _ like _ each _ other _
and _ they _ 're _ real _ happy _ with _ one _ another _
and _ she _ says _ things _ like _ i _ 'm _ really _ glad _ when _ he _ comes _ home _
and _ there _ 's _ not _ enough _ time _ to _ spend _ with _ him _ in _ the _ evening _
and _
oh _ that _ 's _ neat _
i _ 'm _ like _ really _
that _ 's _ good _ you _ know _
i _ like _ to _ see _ that _
yeah _
you _ know _ i _ have _ uh _ some _ friends _ that _ uh _
first _ of _ all _ uh _ the _ girls _ joined _
they _ have _ two _ girls _
one _ joined _ the _ girl _ scouts _
and _ the _ other _ was _ in _ the _ brownies _
and _ then _ the _ mother _ got _ involved _ as _ a _ leader _
and _ then _ all _ of _ a _ sudden _ the _ father _ was _ getting _ involved _ with _ doing _ nature _ hikes _ for _ them _ and _ working _ with _ the _ girl _ scout _ camp _ here _ in _ dallas _ and _ then _ going _ out _ to _ uh _ betty _ perot _ camp _ and _ working _ with _ the _ horses _ and _ stuff _
and _ they _ 're _ gone _ a _ lot _
and _ they _ take _ their _ girls _
and _ they _ go _ away _ for _ weekends _ and _ in _ the _ winter _ time _ even _ you _ know _ to _ do _ work _ with _ the _ girl _ scouts _
and _ i _ think _ it _ 's _ neat _
oh _ yeah _
you _ know _ they _ 've _ really _ become _ very _ much _ involved _ in E in _ just _ that _ one _ organization _
which _ the _ organization _ can _ use _ the _ help _ too _
right _
so _ i E i _ wish _ i _ could _ see _ more _ of _ that _ you _ know _
on _ sunday _ we _ just _ met _ uh _ a _ family _
we _ were _ thinking _ about _ getting _ cat _
and _ we _ went _ over _ to _ uh _ lady _ that _ breeds _ them _ here _ in _ town _
and _ uh _ her _ daughter _ actually _ was _
she _ said _ that _ her _ husband _ said _ to _ her _ daughter _ you _ need _ a _ hobby _
so _ she _ chose _ the _ cats _
oh _
and _ you _ can _ tell _ it _ 's _ a _ family _ hobby _
they _ 're _ all _ a _ part _ of _ it _
and _ it _ was _ really _ neat _ because _ they _ all _ were _ interested _ in _ each _ other _ and E and _ the _ cats _
and _ they _ raise _ champion _ cats _
so _ they _ 've _ done _ really _ well _
ugh _
those _ are _ neat _ cats _ too _
yeah _
i _ 've _ just _ learned _ about _ that _ breed _
they _ 're _ really _ nice _ looking _ cats _
i _ have _ seven _ cats _
but _ they _ 're _ all _ mongrels _
well _ that _ 's _ what _ we _ 're _ going _ to _ end _ up _ getting _
well _ they _ 're _ the _ ones _ that _ need _ the _ homes _
oh _ yeah _
you _ know _ mine _ were _ just _ all _ uh _ strays _ in _ the _ neighborhood _
little _ baby _ kittens _ dropped _ and _ stuff _
and _ it _ just _ kind _ of _ built _
one _ at _ a _ time _ just _
i _ could _ n't _ you _ know _
one _ time _ two _ of _ them _ came _ at _ once _
and _ i _ ca _ n't _ turn _ a _ hungry _ cat _ down _
oh _ i _ know _
so _ you _ know _
and _ the _ last _ one _ that _ i _ was _ here _ uh _
the _ kids _ brought _ him _ over _ and _ said _ he _ was _ injured _
and _ it _ was _ winter _ time _
and _ i _ said _ i _ just _ can _ not _ have _ another _ cat _
i _ just _ can _ not _ have _ another _ cat _
and _ i _ looked _ out _ there _
and _ he _ was _ just _ laying _ on _ my _ lawn _ just _ shivering _ and _ all _
oh _
and _ i _ said _ i _ ca _ n't _ stand _ it _
i _ brought _ him _ in _ so _
those _ are _ my _ children _
we _ do _ n't _ have _ very _ many _ activities _
but _
no _
i _ know _ what _ you _ mean _
our _ cat _ hates _ other _ cats _
and _ we _ 've _ tried _ to _ get _ her _ to _ like _ other _ cats _
and _ she E just E uh E she _ wants _ to _ be _ around _ human _ beings _
and _ she _ does _ not _ want _ to _ be _ around _ other _ cats _
so _ our _ next _ uh _
we _ 're _ going _ to _ try _ it _ with _ a _ kitten _ and _ see _ if _ her _ maternal _ instincts _ come _ out _
ha E ha E lots _ of _ luck _
is _ she _ spayed _
yeah _
oh _ yeah _
real _ maternal _
we _ 're _ hoping _
it _ 's _ our _ last _ hope _
she _ 'll _ eventually _
i _ mean _ mine E you _ know _ i _ have _ five _ males _ and _ two _ females _
everybody _ 's _ spayed _
everybody _ 's _ neutered _
and _ we _ still _ have _ a _ scrap _ every _ now _ and _ then _
nothing _ real _ bad _ you _ know _
a _ slap _ here _ and _ there _
but _ uh _ they _ put _ up _ with _ each _ other _
and _ they _ will _ eventually _
her _ nose _ will _ be _ out _ of _ joint _ for _ a _ while _
and _ she _ 'll _ hiss _ and _ growl _ and _ slap _ every _ now _ and _ then _
but _ they E 'll E she _ 'll _ finally _ accept _ it _
you _ know _ they _ really _ do _ n't _ have _ any _ choice _
they _
in _ my _ household _ we _ have _ a _ little _ bit _ of _ uh _ a _ fight _ for _ whose _ boss _
i _ mean _ a _ male _ cats _ are E are _ you _ know _ real _ territorial _
and _ so _ that _ 's _ the _ big _ battle _ here _ you _ know _
of _ whose E whose _ top E dog _ top _ cat _ i _ guess _
uh-huh _
you _ know _ but _ uh _
i E i _ do _ n't _ know _
i _ do _ n't _ have _ a _ problem _ with _ it _
i _ think _ they _ just _ learn _ to _ accept _
and _ i _ have _ two _ dogs _ too _
and _ they _ 've _ slapped _ the _ dogs _ around _ too _
yeah _
yeah _
every _ now _ and _ then _
so _
that _ 's _ true _
they _ 've _ got _ to _ keep _ them _ in _ line _
yeah _
but _ she _ 'll _ accept _ another _ cat _ eventually _
as _ long _ as _ you _ make _ her _ feel _ uh _ like _ she _ 's _ still _ loved _ and _ everything _
so _
yeah _
well _ those _ cats _ were _ great _
they _ were _ fourteen _ pounds _ and _
and _
oh _ they _ 're _ just _ gorgeous _
but _ yeah _
it _
three _ hundred _ and _ fifty _ dollars _ for _ a _ kitten _
oh _ my _ gosh _
and _ i _ think _ of _ those _
i _ think _ of _ the _ kittens _ at _ the _ pound _
yeah _
three _ hundred _ and _ fifty _ dollars _ hispers _
yeah _
yeah _
and _ they _ are _ lovely _
but _
till _ whispering _ ugh _
house _ payment _
right _
that _ is _ a _ lot _ of _ money _
yeah _
and _ then _ she _ 's _ saying _ you _ know _ you _ ca _ n't _ let _ them _ outside _
and _ you _ ca _ n't _ do _ all _ this _ stuff _
and _ i _ 'm _ like _ ugh _ you _ know _
i _ do _ n't _ let _ mine _ out _ anyway _
but _
i _ let _ two _ of _ them _ out _ just _ in _ the _ back _ yard _ every _ now _ and _ then _
but _ my _ cats _ are _
i _ 'm _ afraid _ you _ know _ the _ neighbors _ will _
people _ throw _ rocks _ at _ them _
and _ people _ run _ over _ them _
and _ i E i _ just _ you _ know _ i _ just _ do _ n't _
i _ know _
and E and _ now _ they _ 've _ lost _ the _ desire _
most _ of _ them _ do _ n't _ even _ try _ to E you _ know _ to _ go _ out _
i _ just _ have _ two _ that _ drive _ me _ crazy _ that _ i _ let _ out _ in _ the _ back _ you _ know _
but _ i _ wo _ n't _ let _ them _ get _
if _ they _ start _ going _ in _ the _ front _ and _ stuff _ i _ bring _ them _ in _
oh _
you _ know _ i _ just _ worry _
i _ guess _ i _ 'm _ too _ protective _
but _ you _ know _
i _ see _ these _ cats _ that _ are _ wandering _ around _ the _ neighborhood _
and _ too _ they _ can _ catch _ diseases _ really _ easy _
yeah _
yeah _
just _ by _ touching _ a _ nose _ to _ another _ cat _ they _ can _ leukemia _ feline _ leukemia _
so _
yeah _
we _ know _ we _ try E try _ real _ hard _ to _ keep _ them _ healthy _
uh E we _ just _ bought _ uh E acre E a _ house _ with _ an _ acre _ to _ try _ to _ so _ she _ 'll _ have _ some _ room _ to _ walk _ around _ and _ not _ off _ of _ a _ busy _ street _
oh _ how _ neat _
we E 're E we _ 're _ choosing _ our _ house _ for _ our _ cat _
is _ n't _ that _ bad _
people _ do _ it _ for _ their _ children _
i _ mean _ why _ not _
oh _ them _ too _
well _ you _ know _ why _ not _
why _ not _
because _ i E she _ loves _ she _ 's _ one _ of _ those _ that _ loves _ outside _
yeah _
and E and _ she _ does _ n't _ go _ far _
but _ she _ just _ wants _ to _ be _ able _ to _ have _ that _ freedom _
yeah _
well E if _ you _ 're _ off E off _ of E a E you _ know _ away _ from _ a _ road _
and _
you _ 're _ off _ of _ the _ main _ road _ you _ said _
yeah _
yeah _
away _ from _ a _ road _ you _ know _ and _ you _ keep _ an _ eye _ on _ her _ it _ 's _ probably _ okay _
i _ 'm _ just _ real _
i _ do _ n't _ know _ i _ guess _
i _ 'm _ in _ a _ neighborhood _
and _ it E 's E it _ 's _ just _ real _ tough _ on _ animals _ here _ you _ know _
yeah _
it _ gets _ hard _ especially _ with _ the _ cars _
i E every _ time _ i _ see _ one _ run _ over _ i _ just _ you _ know _
it _ makes _ me _ sick _
so _ you _ know _
oh _ i _ know _
but _ anyway _ we _ kind _ of _ got _ off _ the _ subject _ of _ children _
yeah _
except _ that _ i _ consider _ them _ my _ children _
yeah _
our _ cats _ are _ our _ kids _
or _
yeah _
i E we _ we _ got _ married _ a _ few _ months _ ago _
and _ i _ 'm _ like _ well _ why _ ca _ n't _ ashley _ be _ at _ the _ wedding _
oh _ no _
in E in _ her _ little _ bridesmaid _ dress _
yeah _
you _ know _ if _ i _ could _ have _ i _ would _ have _
well _ i _ 'm _ sure _ it _ 's _ been _ done _
i _ 'm _ sure _ it _ has _ been _ done _
well _ they _ have _ weddings _ for _ dogs _ now _ and _ cats _
and _
oh _
you _ know _ they _ have _ all _ that _ parties _ for _ them _ where _ they _ dress _ up _
i _ 've _ seen _ it _ in _ magazines _ and _ stuff _ where _ you _ dress _ your _ animals _ up _ and _ take _ them _ to _ a _
oh _ my _
i _ have _ n't _ gone _ that _ far _
i _ 'm _ not _ that _ bonkers _
no _
you _ know _ my _ cats _ do _ not _ wear _ clothes _
an _
i E i _ do _ n't _ think _ they _ 'd _ like _ to _
no _
i _ put _ a _ bow _ on _ her _ one E one _ day _
and _ jerry _ just _ kept _ saying _ you _ are _ the _ meanest _ person _
i _ took _ a _ picture _ of _ her _
and _ that _ was _ all E it E all _ it _ lasted _ for _
do _ any _ of _ your _ friends _ have E have _ uh E older _ children _ that _ they _ do _ anything _ with _
do E do _ you _ have _ friends _ with _ older _ children _
or _ do _ they _ just _ all _ have _ young _ kids _
um _ yeah _
all _ the _ ones _ i _ know _
my _ brother-in-law _ has _ three _ young _ kids _ seven _ and _ on _ down _
and _ they E they _ go _ on _ family _ vacations _
and _ uh E they _ go E like E to _ go _ skiing _
the E the _ middle _ girl _ does _ n't _ get _ a _ whole _ lot _ of _ attention _
but _ uh _ this _ last _ ski _ trip _ they _ took _ uh _ she _ had _ contracted _ chicken _ pox _ first _
and _ then _ she _ spread _ it _ to _ her E her _ younger _ sister _ and _ her _ brother _
and _ they _ got _ it _ just _ at _ the _ beginning _ of _ the _ vacation _ where _ she _ got _ better _
so _ not _ only _ is _ she _ the _ better _ skier _ but _ she _ got _ all _ the _ attention _ because _ she _ got _ to _ go _ out _
i _ think _ she _ planned _ it _
she _ 's _ only _ five _
but _ i _ think _ she _ planned _ it _
and _ she _ got _ all _ the _ attention _ from _ her _ dad _
oh _ see _ there _
she _ needed _ that _ did _ n't _ she _
oh _ yeah _
you _ know _ it _ must _ be _ hard _ when _ you _ have _ a _ lot _ of _ children _
i E you _ know _ to _ i _ was _ an _ only _ child _
my _ mother _ was _ an _ only _ child _
so _ i E you _ know _ i _ was _ n't _ raised _ with _ brothers _ or _ sisters _
and _ i _ always _ got _ all _ the _ attention _
so _ i _ would _ n't _ know _
i _ think _ i _ would _ be _ extremely _ jealous _ or _ would _ have _ been _ had _ there _ been _ another _ child _ in _ the _ family _
yeah _
it E 's E it _ 's _ we _ can _ see _ it _ work _ with _ her _
tough _
it _ must _ be _ tough _
she _ 's _ frustrated _
yeah _
yeah _
she E she _ 's _ the _ middle _ one _
yeah _
so _ she _ 's _ never _ been _ the _ only _ one _
so _ she _ really _ does _ n't _ even _ know _ what _ it _ is _ to _ be _ the _ only _ one _
right _
yeah _
that _ 's _ tough _ you _ know _
so _ what _ do _ you _
what _ 's _ your _ opinion _ on _ the E our _ policy _ down _ there _
i _ do _ n't _ think _ we _ have _ one _
i _ did _ n't _ know _ we _ had _ one _ either _
yeah _
i _ was _ going _ to _ say _ it _ 's _ kind _ of _ hard _ to _ have E have _ an _ opinion _
we _ seem _ to _ uh _
whoever _ screams _ the _ loudest _ or _ whoever _ we _ happen _ to _ give _ the _ most _ money _ to _ at _ that _ particular _ time _ we _ seem _ to _ support _ without _ regard _ whether _ it _ 's _ a _ democracy _ or _ a _ anarchy _ or _ anything _ else _
yeah _
i _ do _ n't _
yeah _
the _ only _ thing _ that _ i _ pretty _ much _ know _ about _ is _ the _ central _ american _ policy _ where _ you _ know _ they _ 're _ just _ trying _ to _ you _ know _
military _ action _ in _ panama _ is _ the _ only _ thing _ that _ comes _ to _ my _ mind _ right _ now _
well _ uh _
and _ then _
yeah _
and _ then _ of _ course _ there E was E there _ was _ the E uh E in _ columbia _ with _ the _ drug _ lords _
right _
but _ we _ just _ talked _ a _ lot _
we _ did _ n't _ actually _ do _ anything _
right _
well E that E 's E that _ 's _ what _ i _ was _ about _ to _ say _
we _ did _ n't _ do _ anything _
i _ 'm _ actually _ surprised _ at _ anything _ in _ central _ america _ along _ with _ panama _
i _ 'm _ just _ kind _ of _ surprised _ we _ did _ that _
yeah _
but _ uh _
that E is E that _ is _ pretty _ uh E risky _
i _ mean _
especially _ after _ our _ friend _ jimmy _ carter _ gave _ it _ away _ anyway _
uh-huh _
but _ i _ guess _ they _ had _ to _ finally _ do _ something _
actually _ bush _ has _ been _ better _ at _ that _ than _ i _ thought _
uh-huh _
he _ has _ a E little E more E a _ little _ more _ of _ a _ stand _ on _ policy _ than _ i _ thought _ he _ would _
i _ always _ considered _ him _ kind _ of _ a _ wimp _
he _ takes _ more _ risks _
yeah _
reagan _ is _ kind _ of _ mushmouth _
yeah _
he _ was _
but E but _ i _ guess _ most _ of _ the _ policy _ that _ we _ 're _ using _ now _ is _ uh E a _ combination _ of _ reagan _ and _ carter _ much _ as _ you _ know _ policy _ makers _
yeah _
it _ seems _ that _ the E the _ policies _ of _ pretty _ much _ anywhere _ not _ just _ in _ central _ america _ that _ u _ s _ has _ now _ is E is _ you _ know _ more _ action _ than _ just _ words _ than _ just _ rhetoric _
but _ you _ know _ we E we _ back _ up _ what E we E what _ we _ say _ with _ actions _
uh _ yeah _
we _ have _ so _ far _
but _ we _ really _ have _ n't _
i _ do _ n't _ know _ how _ long _ it _ 's _ going _ to _ last _
of _ course _ we _ really _ have _ n't _ taken _ on _ the _ drug _ lords _ yet _
yeah _
i _ 'd _ be _ interested _ to _ see _ if _ we _ do _ that _
well _ i _ do _ n't _ think _ it _ 's _ possible _ because _ even _ though _ you _ know _ we _ 're _ against _ them _ i _ do _ n't _ think _ we _ can _ go _ into _ another _ country _ and _ do _ something _ about _ the _ other _ country _ 's _ problem _
well _ we _ did _ in _ panama _
we _ did _ in _ saudi _ arabia _
yeah _
but _
no _
but _ see E the _ thing _ when _ panama _ was _ uh E the _ that _ uh E noriega _ was E uh E was _ was _ uh E was _ wanted _ either _ the _ f _ b _ i _ by _ the _ f _ b _ i _
and _ therefore _ they _ had _ a _ reason _
but _ to _ go _ in _ and _ take _ out _ the _ whole _ drug _ kingdom _ would _ be _ something _ totally _ different _ because _
it _ could _ be _ an _ interesting E interesting _ problem _
right _
i _ do _ n't _ know _ if _ they _ could _ do _ it _ or _ not _
did _ you _ read _ tom _ clancy _ 's _ a _ clear _ and _ present _ danger _
uh _ no _
i _ did _ n't _
i _ think _ you _ need _ to _ pick _ that _ up _ and _ read _ it _
it E 's E quite E uh E it _ 's _ it _ 's _ quite _ interesting _
it _ addresses _ the _ problem _
oh _ the _ drug _ problem _
uh-huh _
uh-huh _
actually _ he E he _ wrote _ that _ prior _ to _ the _ uh E medellin _ cartel _ being _ exposed _
it _ was _ on _ the _ stands _ prior _ to _ that _ time _
it E it _ 's _ quite _ timely _
and _ either _ he _ knows _ somebody _
or _ he _ has _ a E real E good E a _ real _ good _ imagination _
because _ its E it _ hits _ pretty _ close _ to _ home _
yeah _
but _ i _ do _ n't _ think _ we _ 're _ going _ to _ have _ much _ of _ a _ choice _ in _ either _ central _ or _ south _ america _
i E do E n't E think E uh E i _ do _ n't _ think _ the E the _ uh E problem _ about _ drugs _ is _ going _ to _ be _ safe _ any _ time _ soon _
i _ mean _ you _ know _ it E i _ think _ it _ pretty _ much _ got _ sidetracked _ with E uh E with _ the _ panama _ and E and _ with _ the _ middle _ east _ problems _
things _ that E that _ are _ important _ take _ precedent _ precedence _ over _ the _ drugs _ i _ think _
i E think E i _ think _ the _ big _ thing _ is _ trying _ to _ stop _ here _ on _ the _ home _ front _
and _
you _ know _ it E it _ 'll _ take _ a _ little _ bit _ of _ time _ before _ they _ 'll _ realize _ that _ this _ is _ failing _
so _ they _ 're _ going _ to _ have _ to _ go _ to _ the _ source _
um _ yeah _
i _ think _ we _ realize _ it _ 's _ failed _
we E just E do E n't E we _ just _ do _ n't _
nobody E wants E to E make E the E nobody _ wants _ to _ make _ the _ unpopular _ decision _ of _ going _ in _ and _ invading _
do _ n't _ want _ to _ admit _ it _ yet _
right _
we E still E there _ 's _ still _ there _ 's _ still _ too _ many _ kennedys _ and E and _ all _ up _ there _
yep _ ause _
yeah _
that _ 's _ true _
there _ 's _ too _ many _ liberals _ in _ control _
they _ ca _ n't _ agree _ on _ anything _
and _ they _ have _ blinders _ on _ as _ far _ as _ the _ policy _ goes _
as _ long _ as _ somebody _ 's _ getting _ killed _ as _ long _ as _ nobody _ knows _ about _ it _ it _ 's _ okay _
but E but _ the _ minute _ it _ hit E hits _ the _ paper _ then _ of _ course _ the _ kennedys _ and E the E and _ the _ and _ the _ and _ uh E the _ from _ georgia _ all _ stand _ up _ and _ scream _ and _ yell _ about _ what _ a _ horrible _ thing _ it _ is _
yeah _
of _ course _ these _ are _ the _ same _ people _ that _ also _ drown _ the _ chappaquiddic _ and _ stuff _ like _ that _ you _ know _
huh _
but _ i _ guess _ it _
i _ guess _ it _ 's _ automatic _ respective _
depends _ on _ how _ much _ power _ you _ have _ and _ who _ you _ know _
yeah _
you _ know _ the _ people _ have _ a _ right _ to _ know _ except _ about _ what _ it _ about _ what _ concerns _ them _
yeah _
and _ these _ are _ the _ people _ that _ make _ the _ foreign _ policy _
and _ it E it _ 's _ probably _ basically _ uh E
i _ would _ not _ be _ surprised _ if _ the _ kennedy _ foundation _ or _ some _ of _ those _ do _ n't _ have _ a _ lot _ of _ uh E financial _ holdings _ in E in _ central _ and _ south _ america _
probably _
considering _ the _ kennedys _ made _ all _ their _ money _ off _ bootleg _ whiskey _ anyway _
huh _
every _ time _ you _ drink _ scotch _ you _ 're _ paying _ kennedys _
i _ do _ n't _ drink _ scotch _
good _
do _ n't _ ever _ drink _ scotch _
it _ 's _ terrible _
i _ quit _ drinking _ scotch _ when _ i _ found _ out _ about _ that _
but _ anyway _
but _ uh E as E far E as E as _ far _ as _ you _ know _ central _ and _ south _ america _ we E our _ policy _ pretty _ much _ uh E it _ depends _ on _ who E we E 're E what _ government _ we _ 're _ buying _ down _ there _ at _ the _ particular _ time _
yeah _
i _ think _ we _ 're _ trying _ to _ stay E uh E stay _ friendly _ with _ uh E the E uh E the _ brazilian _ and E and _ argentinean _ governments _ because _ they _ 're _ producing _ so _ much _ uh E agricultural _ exports _
we _
we _ do _ n't _ want _ to _ piss _ them _ off _ and _ have _ them _ over _ produce _
yeah _
although _ we _ do _ need _ to _ do _ something _ about _ you _ know _
of _ course _ in _ nicaragua _ and _ around _ there _ with _ the _ sandinistas _ and _ the _ contras _ that _ 's _ been _ going _ on _ for _ years _
but _ then _ hell _ it _ 's _ probably _ still _ be _ going _ on _ long _ after _ we _ 're _ dead _
it _ 'll _ still _ be _ the _ same _ thing _
those _ people _ down _ there _ do _ n't _ really _
i _ mean _
i _ think _ it _ 's _ going _ to _ have _ to _ get _ worse _ before _ it _ gets _ better _
you _ know _ the _ same _ old _ cliche _
well _ i _ think _ basically _ they _ ca _ n't _ figure _ out _ what _ they _ want _ down _ there _
right _
if _ you _ give _ everybody _ what _ they _ wanted _ there _ is _ a _ complete _ democracy _ those _ people _ would _ n't _ know _ how _ to _ react _ because _ they _ have _ no _ education _
right _
and _ they _ 'll _ just _ pick _ crooked _ people _ again _
and _ then _ people E the _ the _ wrong _ people _ will _ just _ fight _ their _ way _ up _ to _ the _ top _ again _
and _ it _ 'll _ all _ be _ for _ nothing _
it _ 's _ all _ tradition _
it _ 's _ all _ traditional _
they _ have _ to _
you _ have _ the _ ruling _ class _
and _ you _ have _ everybody _ else _
yeah _
well _ i _ guess _ that _ 's _ about _ five _ minutes _
appreciate _ talking _ to _ you _
was _ very _ pleasant _
all _ righty _
good _ talking _ to _ you _
hey _ what _ was _ that _ book _
what _ was _ that _ book _ that _ you _ were _ saying _ to _ read _ again _
tom _ clancy _
it _ 's _ called _ a _ clear _ and _ present _ danger _
a _ clear _ and _ present _ danger _
uh-huh _
he E he _ 's _ the _ one _ who _ wrote _ uh E red _ october _ a _ hunt _ for _ red _ october _
okay _
all _ right _
and _ i _ think _ if _ you _ read _ that _ i _ think _ you _ 'll _ get _ a _ real _ kick _ out _ of _ it _
all _ right _
thanks _ a _ lot _
all _ righty _
bye-bye _
bye _
clanking _ ishes _ oman _ and _ children _
well E as _ much _ as _ i _ 'd _ uh E i _ 'd _ like _ to _ say _ that _ i _ 'll _ be _ looking _ for _ a _ flashy _ convertible _ or E uh E or _ a _ four _ by _ four _ or _ something _
i _ guess _ the _ next _ car _ i _ 'll _ be _ looking _ for _ is _ a _ kind _ of _ a _ plain _ old _ four _ door _
what _ kind _ of _ a _ car _ do _ you _ have _ now _
oh E we _ 've _ got _ a E uh E an _ older _ delta _ eighty-eight _
and _ then _ uh E our E our _ newer _ car _ is _ a E uh E a _ corsica _
yeah _
and _ we _ 'll _ probably _ be _ looking _ for _ something _ about _ that E uh E that _ same _ style _
yeah _
that _ same _ kind _ of _ four _ door _ hard _ top _ style _
you _ got _ kids _
uh _ no _
but _ we _ 're _ planning _ for _ it _
okay _
so _ uh E in _ fact _ uh E our _ oldsmobile _ is E a E is _ a E like E an _ old _ delta _ eighty-eight _
but _ it _ 's _ in E pretty _ good _ in _ really _ good _ shape _
yeah _
and _ we _ 've _ been _ really _ pleased _ with _ oldsmobiles _
yeah _
so _ that _ 's _ probably _ where _ the _ first _ place _ we _ 'd _ look _
huh _
but _ uh _
well _ we _ 've _ always _ had _ uh _ fords _
uh-huh _
uh _ mostly _ because _ my _ wife _ 's _ stepfather _ works _ at _ a _ ford _ dealership _
that _ 'll _ do _ it _
yeah _
that _ 'll _ do _ it _
um E but _ yeah E we E 're E we _ 're _ in _ the _ same _ shape _
i _ think _ our _ next _ car _ will _ be _ a E you _ know _ some _ big _ old _ four _ door _ uh E something _ that _ can _ haul _ the _ kids _ to _ baseball _ practice _ and _ piano _ lessons _
yeah _
and _ we _ 've _ got _ a _ minivan _
uh-huh _
and _ that _ 's _ great _
and _ i _ drive _ uh _
well _ i _ used _ to _ drive _ an _ escort _
but _ it _ died _ on _ me _
so _ i E i _ mean _ i _ i _ i _ used _ to _ run _ it _ i E uh E where _ we _ used _ to _ live _ i _ used _ to _ commute _ a _ hundred _ and _ forty _ miles _ a _ day _
oh _ geez _
and E uh E and _ this _ escort _ took _ it _ all _
and _ it E it _ it _ got _ up _ to _ uh E uh E i _ was _ at _ ninety-four _ thousand _ miles _ on _ it _
and _ the _ engine _ just _ went _
uh-huh _
so _ i E i _ i _ bought _ a _ used _ uh E dodge _ aries _ which _ has _ been _ okay _
yeah _
really _
i E i _ mean _ i _ 've _ have _ n't _ had _ it _ that _ long _
uh-huh _
but _ it E it _ it _ 's _ an _ eighty-five _ aries _
but _ it _ only _ had _ thirty-four _ thousand _ miles _ on _ it _ when _ i _ bought _ it _
oh _ geez _
and _ i E just E you _ know _ i _ just _ drive _ it _ to _ work _
so _ it _ 's _ just _ a _ ten _ minute _ commute _ every _ day _
uh-huh _
so _ uh _ it _ does _ n't _ get _ much _ of _ uh _
i _ mean _ it _ 's _ not _ like _ i _ 'm _ putting _ it _ through _ its _ paces _
yeah _
yeah _
but _ i _ think _ uh _
and _ it _ 's _ a _ four _ door _ which _ is _ nice _
uh-huh _
but _ it _ 's _ still _ a _ little _ cramped _
i _ 've _ got _ three _ kids _
yeah _
so _ i E i _
sounds _ like _ you E you _ need _ at _ least _ like E a _ taurus _ size _ or _ something _ like _ that _
yeah _
that _ 's _ what _ i _ was _ thinking _ of _
was _ a _ taurus _
uh _
yeah _
i E i _ know _ a _ lot _ of _ guys _ at _ work _
they E uh E the _ ones _ that _ have _ uh E families _ uh E
and _ they _ still _ want _ kind _ of _ a _ sports _ car _
they E 've E been E uh E a _ lot _ of _ them _ have _ been _ getting _ these _ taurus _ s _ h _ o _ 's _
that E i _ guess _ it _ 's _ the _ sports _ version _ of _ the _ taurus _
oh _ really _
yeah _
in _ fact _ it _ comes _ with _ a _ standard _ stick _
and E uh E and _ a _ lot _ of _ those _
ooh _
and _ it _ comes _ with _ a _ bigger _ engine _ and _ the _ things _ like _ that _
but _ uh _
yeah _
and _ usually _ they _ 're _ in _ like _ black _ and _ gun _ metal _ grey _ and _ those _ kind _ of _ colors _
you _ 're _ not _ going _ to _ see _ too _ many _ uh _ you _ know _ green _ ones _ or _ blue _ ones _ or _ anything _ like _ that _
yeah _
they E they _ put _ them _ in _ sporty _ colors _ i _ guess _
but _ uh _
yeah _
well _ my _ wife _ wants _ a _ miyata _
oh _ well _ sure _
that _ 's _ what _ you _ know _
until E until _ you _ look _ at _ the _ price _ tag _
and _ then _ you _ go _ what _
right _
what _ would _ i _ besides _ tooling _ around _ and _ looking _ really _ cool _ and _ having _ a _ lot _ of _ fun _ what _ would _ i _ really _ do _ with _ this _ car _
right _
yeah _
i _ know _
i _ know _
it _ 's _ like _ i E i _ guess _ i _ could _ fit _ in _ it _ maybe _
yeah _
i E i _ went _ i _ went _ through _ that _ when _ i _ first _ got _ out _ of _ uh E college _
i _ had _ an _ old _ car _ that _ i _ bought _ just _ to _ get _ to E to _ my E my _ first _ job _
yeah _
and _ when _ i _ got _ there _ the _ first _ thing _ i _ did _ was _ trade _ it _ in _ on _ a _ spitfire _
oh _
and _ i E i _ knew _ that _ was _ going _ to _ be _ the _ only _ time _ i _ could _ afford _ a _ two _ seater _ uh E sports _ car _
yeah _
but _ that E that _ just _ does _ not _ make _ it _ as _ an _ only _ car _
it E 's E uh E it _ 's _ like _ i E i _ would _
i _ bought _ a _ set _ of _ stereo _ speakers _
yeah _
and _ it _ was _ one _ of _ those _ cash _ and _ carry _ deals _
i _ had _ to _ take _ them _ one _ at _ a _ time _ with _ the _ top _ down _
and _ it _ was _ winter _ so _ i _ was _ in _ like _ this _ coat _ with _ the _ top _ down _
oh _ no _
and _ the _ speaker _ in _ the _ passenger _ seat _
yeah _
and _ i _ drove _ that _ one _ home _
and _ then _ i _ went _ back _ and _ got _ the _ other _ one _ and _ put _ that _ in _ the _ passenger _ seat _ and _ drove _ that _ one _ home _
and _ uh _ funny _ funniest _ sight _
and _ you _ kind _ of _ outgrow _ that _ real _ quick _ when _ it _ 's _ your _ only _ car _
yeah _
yeah _
well _ i _
you _ know _ it _ 's _ funny _
most _ people _ that _ i _ 've _ talked _ to _ did _ stuff _ like _ that _ when _ they _ were _ in _ college _ or E you _ know _ or _ when _ they _ were _ single _ anyway _
uh-huh _
yeah _
they E 'd E they _ 'd _ buy _ themselves _ a _ sporty _ car _ because _ it _ was _ their _ last _
i _ never _ did _ that _
uh _ you _ know _ my _ first _ car _ was _ a _ toyota _ corolla _
oh _ really _
and _ uh _ because _ i _ got _ a _ good _ deal _ on _ it _
yeah _
and _ uh _ that _ was _ a _ great _ little _ car _
actually _ i _ met _
that _ 's _ how _ i _ met _ girls _ was _ i _ 'd _ find _ out _ if _ a _ girl _ could _ drive _ a _ manual _ transmission _ which _ i E i _ had _ never _
i E i _ 'd _ learned _ on _ an _ automatic _ transmission _ and E so E so _ i _ 'd _ go _ out _ on _ dates _ where _ they _ would _ teach _ me _ how _ to _ drive _ this _ car _
uh-huh _
boy _ that _ 's _ a _ good _ deal _
and _ uh _ in _ fact _ i _ married _ one _ of _ those _ people _
ah _ okay _
well _ i _ 'll _ have _ to _ remember _ that _ if _ i _ ever _ get _ in _ that _ situation _ again _
and _ it _ worked _
yeah _
it _ worked _ all _ right _ real _ good _
huh _
because _ i E i _ know _ we _ 've _ uh E
that E 's E that _ 's _ something _ that E that _ we _ definitely _ have _ to _ go _ with _ is _ an _ automatic _ transmission _
my E uh E my _ wife _ just _ ca E n't E ca _ n't _ uh E
she _ really _ does _ n't _ want _ to _ learn _ i _ guess _ the E uh E the _ standard _ shift _
yeah _
yeah _
i _ fact _ i E i _ remember _ once _ we E uh E we _ uh E went E uh E went _ on _ a _ uh E test _ drive _
we _ got _ one _ of _ these _ things _ from _ lee _ iacocca _ that _ said _ you _ know _ i _ 'll _ give _ you _ a _ fifty _ dollar _ savings _ bond _ if _ you _ 'll _ test _ drive _ a _ car _
yeah _
yeah _
and _ we E went E uh E we _ went _ uh E we _ went _ to _ a _ dealership _
and _ uh E it E it _ was _ she E she _ did _ pretty _ well _
but _ it _ was _ one _ of _ those _ things _ where _ we _ just _ went _ to _ a _ big _ parking _ lot _
yeah _
and _ the _ uh _ dealer _ kind _ of _ gave _ her _ standard _ shift _ parking _
because _ that _ was _ all _ it _ was _
it E was E it _ was _ the _ funniest _ thing _
it _ was _ like _ uh _ a _ big _ le _ baron _
it _ was _ a _ le _ baron _ with _ everything _ on _ it _
wow _
but _ it _ had _ a _ standard _ shift _
it _ was _ the _ craziest _ thing _ i _ ever _ saw _
that _ 's _ weird _
yeah _
and E and _ and _ that _ 's _ probably _ why _ they _ were _ trying _ to _ sell _ them _ i _ guess _
huh _
and _ uh _ we _ just _ kind _ of _ went _ back _ and _ forth _ and _ back _ and _ forth _
she _ did _ pretty _ well _ after _ a _ while _
yeah _
but _ uh _ it _ 's _ just _ kind _ of _ hard _ to _ learn _ i _ guess _
well _ my _ wife _
i _ mean _ she _ 'd _ always _ driven _ standard _ transmission _
uh-huh _
and E uh E and _
in _ fact _ all _ our _ earlier _ cars _ were _ a _ standard _ transmission _
in _ fact _ the _ minivan _ 's E a E has _ a _ stick _ shift _
um _ okay _
and _ in _
this _ dodge _ aries _ is _ the _ first _ car _ we _ 've _ ever _ gotten _ that _ had _ anything _
you _ know _ it _ 's _ got _ automatic _ transmission _ cruise _ control _ you _ know _ electric _ locks _
oh _ geez _
you _ know _ it E 's E like E it _ 's _ like _ a _ luxury _ car _ except _ that _ it _ 's _ the _ dodge _ aries _ you _ know _
yeah _
yeah _
so _ uh _
oh _ well _
well E i E guess E that E 's E i _ guess _ that _ 's _ about _ all _ i _ 've _ got _ to _ say _ about _ cars _
well _ you _ um _
the E the _ thing _ about _ this _ uh E
i _ will _ say _ this _ about _ the _ minivan _
uh-huh _
we _ thought _ that _ was _ a _ luxury _ car _ when _ we _ bought _ it _
uh-huh _
i _ would _ think _ so _
yeah _
it E it _
because _ it _ 's _ so _ big _
yeah _
and E and _ it _ was _ quiet _
it _ had _ a _ stereo _ system _
oh _ yeah _
we _ never _ had _ it _ you _ know _
we _ always _ had _ the _ a _ m _ radio _
sure _
sure _
and _ uh _ of _ course _ this _ has _ this _ that _ had _ speakers _ that _ you _ can _ control _ from _ the _ back _ seat _
uh-huh _
and _ you _ can _ change _ the _ channels _ on E the E on _ the _ radio _ from _ the _ back _ seat _ too _
uh-huh _
and _ put _ speaker _ phones _ in _ it _
so _
now _ now _ now _ that _ used _ to _ be _ a _ luxury _
but _ i _ bet _ on _ the _ next _ time _ you _ buy _ a _ car _ that _ 's _ going _ to _ be _ mandatory _
right _
you _ 've _ got _ to _ have _ that _ now _
that _ 's _ right _
that _ 's _ right _
you _ 're _ used _ to _ it _
and _ you _ got _ to _ have _ it _
and _ you _ 've _ got _ to _ pay _ for _ it _ too _
yeah _
that _ 's _ true _ too _
and E i E bet E and _ i _ bet _ it _ costs _ twice _ as _ much _ as E as _ when _ i _ bought _ mine _
it E it _ probably _ does _
it _ probably _ does _
but _ uh _
we _
oh _ well _
well _ bill _ it _ 's _ been _ nice _ talking _ to _ you _
nice _ talking _ to _ you _
okay _
you _ have _ a _ good _ evening _
thanks _ a _ lot _
um _
bye-bye _
bye-bye _
what _ kind _
what _ kind _ of _ cars _ do E you E do _ you _ usually _ drive _
right _ now _ we E i _ 've _ got _ a _ uh E four _ year _ old _ subaru _ and _ a _ two _ year _ old _ honda _
oh _ my _ goodness _
well E we E 're E we _ 're _ we _ 're _ sort E of E sort _ of _ a _ general _ motors _ family _
i _ guess _ that _ 's _ the _ way _ we _ were _ raised _
and _ uh _ uh _ we _ were _ overseas _ with _ t _ i _ for _ a _ number _ of _ years _
and _ when _ we _ came _ back _ we _ suddenly _ find _ out _ we _ 've _ got _ five _ licensed _ drivers _ in _ the _ family _
oh _ goodness _
yeah _
and _ four _ cars _
and _ we _ bought _ some _ year _ old _ cars _ from _ national _ car _ rental _
really _
at _ least _ two _ of _ them _
we _ bought _ an _ olds _ calais _ and _ a _ buick _ skylark _
uh _ for _ you _ know _
they _ each _ had _ twenty-one _ thousand _ miles _ or _ something _ like _ that _
uh-huh _
turns _ out _ that _ 's _ a _ pretty _ good _ place _ to _ buy _ cars _ because _ they _ maintain _ them _
and _ they _ can _ show _ you _ the _ records _ they _ 've _ gotten _ all _ their _ maintenance _ on _ schedule _ and _ everything _ like _ that _
uh _ then _ we _ 've _ got _ an _ eighty-six _ chevy _ spectrum _ that _ we _ bought _ new _
my _ daughter _ was _ a _ freshman _ in _ college _ when _ we _ bought _ it _ for _ her _
uh-huh _
and _ we _ 've _ got _ a _ eighty-four _ toyota _ that _ we _ bought _ used _
so _ we _ 've _ got _ four _ cars _ for _ our _ five _ licensed _ drivers _
it _ 's _ like _ musical _ chairs _
i _ bet _
you _ 're _ one _ short _
i _ bet _
and _ uh _
but _ you _ know _ it _ 's _ interesting _ the _ two _
even _ though _ my _ dad _ was _ a _ chevrolet _ man _ forever _ and _ ever _ and _ ever _
and _ we _ were _ in _ the _ retail _ milk _ business _
and _ he _ had _ all _ chevrolet _ milk _ trucks _
and E and _ we _ bought _ automobiles _ and _ all _ that _
it _ was _ almost _ like _
and _ a _ chevrolet _ dealer _ was _ our _ friend _
and _ it _ was _ almost _ like _ the _ minute _ we _ got _ old _ and _ bought _ anything _ like E a E but _ a _ chevrolet _ it _ would _ be _ like _ going _ and _ spitting _ on _ his _ grave _
but _ uh _
yep _
as _ we _ got _ older _ and _ got _ away _
and _ then _ we _ thought _ well _ you _ know _ you _ still _ could _ buy _ general _ motors _ products _
and _ it _ was _ probably _ not _ that _ bad _
but _ uh _ we _ lived _ in _ malaysia _ for _ t _ i _ in _ nineteen _ uh _ eighty-one _ two _ three _ and _ four _
uh-huh _
and E and _ of _ course _ you _ do _ n't _ buy _ general _ motors _ products _ over _ there _
no _
but _ we _ bought _ a _ volvo _
and _ i _ have _ never _ had _ a _ car _ that _ i _ 've _ loved _ more _
i _ just _ ca _ n't _ afford _ them _ here _
uh E but _ i E i _ just _ loved _ that _ car _
uh-huh _
and _ uh _ we _ bought _ a _ uh _
we _ lived _ in _ the _ philippines _ for _ t _ i _ in _ eighty-five _ eighty-six _ and _ eighty-seven _
and _ we _ bought _ a _ uh _ ford _ telstar _
which _ is _ somewhat _ similar _ to _ the _ taurus _
it _ 's _ sold _ in E uh E in _ uh E the _ far _ eastern _ uh E far _ east _ countries _ more _ than _ here _
uh-huh _
but _ we _ really _ liked _ that _
and _ have _ you _ had _ experience _ with _ cars _ other _ than _ the _ ones _ you _ have _
well _ yeah _
we E had E uh E we _ had _
these _ are _ the _ first _ cars _ that _ my _ husband _ and _ i _ have _ ever _ purchased _ ourselves _
um _
the _ others _ were _ hand _ me _ downs _ through _ the _ families _
yeah _
and _ those _ were _ always _ g _ m _ cars _
yeah _
uh _ buicks _ and _ chevrolets _
uh-huh _
and _ uh _ we _ were _ real _ happy _ with _ them _
but _ all _ the _ ones _ that _ we _ ever _ had _ were _ the _ you _ know _ eight _ cylinder _
oh _ yeah _
really _ rugged _ g _ m _ cars _
the E the _ big _
yeah _
and _ all _ we _ had _ heard _ was E was _ a _ lot _ of _ negative _ press _ about _ the _ smaller _ cars _
and _ we _ both _ drive _ well _ forty-five _ miles _ round _ trip _ every _ day _
sure _
sure _
and _ so _ we _ wanted _ a _ smaller _ car _
yeah _
when _ we _ got _ ready _ to _ buy _ we _ needed _ a _ smaller _ car _ to _ get _ better _ gas _ mileage _
and _ quite _ frankly _ we _ were _ afraid _ of E the E of _ the _ g _ m _ small _ cars _
uh-huh _
uh-huh _
you _ know _ as _ far _ as _ durability _
right _
so _ we _ kind _ of _
when _ we _ had _ our _ larger _ cars _ we _ did _ n't _ mind _ uh _ keeping _ them _ up _
uh-huh _
you _ know _ doing _ the _ maintenance _ and _ everything _ on _ them _ as _ long _ as _ we _ did _ n't _ have _ to _ do _ it _ very _ often _
yeah _
but _ once _ they _ got _ over _ a _ hundred _ thousand _ miles _ on _ them _ all _ of _ them _ you _ know _
it _ just _ kind _ of _ seemed _ to _ be _ the _ magic _ number _ for _ them _
yeah _
yeah _
it _ seems _ that _ something _ goes _ every _ month _
yeah _
it _
and _ i _ 'm _ afraid _ we _ 're _ going _ to _ be _ in E that E in _ another _ year _ with _ all _ of _ ours _
you _ know _
we _ got _ three _ eighty-sixes _ and _ an _ eighty-four _
uh-huh _
and _ we _ 'll _ probably _ be _ there _ with _ all _ of _ them _
you _ know _ it _ 's _ the _ same _ thing _ you _ know _
i _ do _ n't _ know _ whether _ uh _ you _ classify _ the _ skylark _ and _ the _ calais _ as _
well _ i _ guess _ they _ 're _ intermediate _
uh-huh _
uh _ but _ uh _ we _ went _ on _ a _ family _ trip _ to _ massachusetts _
and _ there _ were _ five _ of _ us _
and _ five _ five _ of _ us _ never _ go _ anywhere _ together _ here _
everybody _ 's _ heading _ off _ in _ their _ own _ direction _
right _
and _ i _ rented _ a _ buick _ le _ sabre _
uh-huh _
and _ it _ 's _ the _ first _ big _ car _ i _ had _ since _ i _ had _ my _ nine _ passenger _ impala _ station _ wagon _ from _ seventy-six _ to _ eighty _
and _ it _ made _ all _ the _
i E i _ had _ forgotten _ what _ driving _ a _ big _ car _ was _ like _
it _ 's _ like _ a _ yacht _
it _ was _ just _ nice _
it _ floated _
yeah _
what _
we E we _ sold _ or _ we _ we _ traded _ in _ our _ le _ sabre _ for _ our _ subaru _
oh _ yeah _
yeah _
it _ was _ a _ great _ car _
yeah _
it _ just _
we _ ran _ the _ wheels _ right _ off _ of _ it _
yeah _
yeah _
yeah _
and _ uh _ you _ know _ i _ 've _ read _
i _ 'm _ in _ the _ quality _ business _ at _ t _ i _
i _ 'm _ a _ quality _ manager _
and _ we E 're E we _ 're _ uh E we _ deal _
we _ sell _
i _ 'm _ in _ the _ semiconductor _ group _
and _ we _ sell _ to _ uh E ford _ chrysler _ and _ g E m E uh E g _ m _ delco _
uh-huh _
and _ there _ is _ a _ amazing _
i _ am _ just _ uh E really _ impressed _ with E the E with _ the _ quality _ consciousness _ that _ the E these _ companies _ have _ put _ into _ their _ procurement _
and _ it E 's E i E it _ 's _ come _ out _ as _ a _ result _ of _ the _ competition _ from _ the _ japanese _
uh-huh _
and _ uh _ uh _ i _
and _ you _ know _ we _ used _ to _ think _ ford _ products _ were _ tinny _
i _ mean _ i _ was _ growing _ up _
i _ was _ taught _ when _ i _ was _ growing _ up _ you _ know _ that E that _ that _ real _ people _ bought _ general _ motors _ products _
and _ peons _ bought _ ford _ products _
that _ 's _ right _
but _ just _ with _ the _ quality _ requirements _ that _ ford _ is _ putting _ on _ us _ and _ the _ way _ they _ come _ into _ our _ plants _
and _ they _ 're _ really _ uh _ uh _ stressing _ this _ partnerships _ in _ quality _
and _ you _ know _ g _ m _ and _ chrysler _ are _ doing _ that _
but _ i _ really _ think _ ford _ 's _ got _ a _ ship _ position _ in _ this _ right _ now _
and _ i _ think _ it _ 's _ showing _ up _ in _ their _ automobiles _
their _ automobiles _ are _ getting _ a _ very _ good _ quality _ reputation _ right _ now _
uh-huh _
and _ uh _ uh _ we _ went _ to _ uh _ austin _ a _ while _ back _ to _ a _ basketball _ tournament _
and _ we _ were _ going _ to _ be _ meeting _ some _ of _ my _ wife _ 's _ relatives _ down _ there _
so _ we _ decided _ rather _ than _ drive _ one _ of _ our _ cars _ down _ we _ 'd _ rent _ one _
uh-huh _
and _ we _ went _ up _ to _ the _ local _ budget _
and _ we _ were _ going _ to _ get _ a _ olds _ eighty-eight _ or _ something _
he _ said _ i E 'll E tell E you E what E for _ a _ dollar _ a _ day _ more _ i _ 'll _ give _ you _ a _ lincoln _ town _ car _
um _
and _ we _ drove _ that _ down _
and _ i _ hated _ to _ turn _ that _ back _ in _
i _ bet _
we _ had _ that _ for _ three _ days _
and _ i _ absolutely _ loved _
except _ i _ could _ n't _ want _ to _ have _ to _ park _ it _ in _ tight _ places _ all _ the _ time _
no _
uh _
i _ would _ n't _ want _ to _ have _ to _ pay _ for _ the _ gas _ either _
but _ i _ absolutely _ loved _ that _ automobile _
and _ you _ know _ it _ was _ n't _ that _ i _ 'd _
driving _ around _ down _ there _ we _ might _ have _ got _ sixteen _ to _ eighteen _ miles _ per _ gallon _
but _ on _ the _ trip _ down _ and _ back _ i _ filled _ up _ both _ coming _ and _ going _
so _ i _ knew _ what _ i _ actually _ got _ on _ the _ trip _
and _ it _ was _ about _ twenty-four _ miles _ a _ gallon _
uh-huh _
uh _ and _ you _ know _ we _ just _ got _ it _ out _ on _ the _ highway _ and _ put _ it _ in _ cruise _ control _ at _ about _ sixty _ and _ let _ it _ let _ it _ float _
uh-huh _
and _ it _ was _ pretty _ nice _
are E are _ are _ you _ planning _ on _ getting _ any _ additional _ or _ other _ cars _
no _ time _ soon _
uh E we E 're E our E our _ we _ wo _ n't _ have _ any _ more _ licensed _ drivers _ for _ about _ thirteen _ years _
um _
oh _ yours _ is _ small _
yes _
so E we E uh E so _ we _ do _ n't _ plan _ on _ purchasing _ any E more E any _ time _ soon _
both _ of _ our _ cars _ are _ getting _ oh _ around _ sixty _ thousand _ miles _ on _ them _
um _
oh _ yeah _
we _ drive _ a _ lot _
yeah _
you _ got _ another E another _ thirty _ or _ forty _ thousand _ if _ you _ maintain _ them _
uh-huh _
uh _ we _ 've _ got _
probably _ we _ 'll _ get _ something _ in _ the _ next _ couple _ years _
my _ son _ will _ graduate _ from _ high _ school _ this _ year _
and E and _ he _ 's _ going _ to _ go _ to _ richland _ college _ one _ year _ behind _ us _
uh-huh _
it _ 's _ right _
in _ fact _ uh _ our _ house _ is _ adjacent _ to _ the _ richland _ property _
he _ wants _ to _ go _ to _ texas _ tech _
and _ he _ 's _ probably _ going _ to _ have _ to _ go _ to _ richland _ a _ year _ to _ get _ some _ grades _ in _ order _
but _ uh _ the _ next _ year _ when _ he _ goes _ out _ to _ tech _ he _ wants _ a _ pickup _
and _ i _ want _ a _ pickup _
a _ pickup _ aint _
i _ may _ get _ one _ and _ not _ let _ him _ have _ it _
but _ we _ have _ been _ looking _ at _ these _ red _
they E they _ 're _ very _ popular _ around _ here _
uh-huh _
these _ uh _ uh _ red _ chevy _ pickups _
and _ uh _ we _ 'll _ probably _ do _ something _ like _ that _
uh _ uh _ incidentally _
uh _ uh _ i _ do _ n't _ know _
uh E the E uh E the _ credit _ union _ has _ got _ a _ deal _ now _ where _ you _ decide _ what _ you _ want _
and _ you _ call _ this _ number _
and _ uh _ they _ go _ negotiate _ the _ price _ for _ you _
and E and _ or _ or _ send _ you _ to _ a _ guy _ with _ whom _ they _ 've _ already _ got _ a _ deal _
uh-huh _
and _ uh _ my _ boss _ just _ bought _ a _ chevy _ pickup _
and _ he _ got _ three _ thousand _ dollars _ off _ the _ sticker _ price _ doing _ it _ this _ way _
really _
yeah _
and _ uh E uh E you _ know _ you E you _ figure _ out _ the _ options _ go _ around _ look _ at _ the _ dealers _ and _ get _ the _ best _ price _ you _ can _ and _ then _ go _ call _ this _ guy _ and E and _ tell _ him _ what _ you _ want _
and _ he _ 'll _ put _ you _ in _ touch _ with _ a E certain E guy E a _ certain _ person _ at _ that _ dealer _ 's _ place _
uh-huh _
so _ i _ 'm _ going _ to _ try _ that _ the _ next _ time _ i _ buy _ one _
i _ think _ that _ would _ be _ a _ good _ idea _
and E and _ so _ you _ know _ i _ can _ go _ around _ and _ comparison _ shop _ and _ see _ if _ i _ can _ get _ a _ better _ negotiation _ on _ my _ own _
but _ once _ one _ thing _ that _ 's _ a _ pain _ in _ the _ neck _ buying _ automobiles _ is _ negotiating _
yeah _
i E 've E we _ 've _ we _ 've _ we _ 've _ kind _ of _ been _ the _ types _ that _ will _ say _ this _ is _ what _ we _ intend _ to _ spend _
yeah _
this _ is _ the _ car _ we _ want _
will _ you _ sell _ me _ this _ car _ for _ that _ price _
and _ for _ that _ price _
and E and _ we _ 've _ had _
we _ with _ our _
when _ we _ bought _ our _ subaru _ the _ guy _ was _ like _ you _ ca _ n't _ do _ this _ to _ me _
and _ we _ 're E were _ just _ like E okay E fine E we E we _ wo _ n't _ then _
we _ 'll _ go _ somewhere _ else _
yeah _
you _ know _
i _ mean _ he _ 's _ like _ no _ no _ no _
yeah _
but _
and E uh E and _ i E i _ think _ that _ 's _ probably _ the _ way _ you _ 've _ got _ to _ do _ it _
when E when _ i _ was _ young _ i _ went _ in _ and _ bought _ a _ uh E or _ made _ a _ deal _ on _ a _ sixty _
this _ is _ nineteen _ sixty _
i _ 'd _ first _ come _ to _ texas _ and _ made _ a _ deal _ on _ a _ sixty _ red _ impala _ convertible _ that _ i _ just _ loved _
uh-huh _
uh-huh _
and _ this _ guy _ gave _ me _ this _ deal _ you _ know _
i _ told _ him _ how _ much _ i _ wanted _ to _ pay _
and _ for _ every _ fifty _ dollars _ he _ 'd _ have _ to _ go _ in _ and _ check _ with _ the _ boss _
and _ then _ i _ 'd _ have _ to _ sign _ something _ saying _ that _ if _ he _ could _ get _ this _ rate _ uh _ we _ would _ go _ ahead _ and _ buy _
uh _ uh _ if _ he _ could _ get _ this _ rate _ i _ promised _ to _ buy _
and _ i _ left _ there _ on _ a _ saturday _ afternoon _ just _ totally _ exhausted _
i E i _ was _ only _ twenty-five _ years _ old _ or _ something _
uh-huh _
i E i _ left _ there _
and _ i E i _ uh E i _ 'd _ never _ done _ this _ before _ because _ i _ 'd _ always _ bought _ my _ previous _ cars _ from _ the _ guy _ my _ dad _ bought _ his _ milk _ trucks _ from _
and E uh E uh E so _ i E i _ got _ back _
and _ a _ salesman _ that _ lived _ in _ the _ apartment _ had _ asked _ me _ uh _ uh _ if _
he _ 'd _ heard _ i _ was _ going _ to _ get _ a _ car _ and _ asked _ me _ what _ i _ paid _ for _ it _
he _ said _ well _ hey _ uh _ before _ you _ go _ buying _ anything _
he _ says _ call _ this _ friend _ of _ mine _ at _ will _ 's _ point _
there _ was _ a _ guy _ that _ owned _ a _ chevrolet _ dealership _ up _ there _
uh-huh _
and _ i _ called _ the _ guy _ and _ made _ an _ appointment _ to _ come _ up _ monday _ morning _
and _ just _ driving _ fifty _ miles _ out _ of _ town _ it _ was _ a _ difference _
and _ i _ mean _ it _ was _ a _ difference _ of _ four _ hundred _ dollars _
but _ this _ was _ four _ hundred _ dollars _ on _ only _ twenty-five _ hundred _
goodness _
is _ all _ we _ paid _ for _ cars _ in _ those _ days _
and E uh E uh E so _ i _ called _ back _ the _ guy _ in _ dallas _
and _ i _ told _ him _ that _
i _ 'd _ left _ him _ a _ check _ for _ tax _ title _ and _ license _ and _ everything _
and _ i _ said _ i _ want _ to _ cancel _ my _ order _ and E and _ do _ n't _ try _ to _ cash _ the _ check _ because _ i E 'm E going E to E i _ 've _ stopped _ payment _ on _ it _ already _
and _ he _ says _ oh _ somebody _ 's _ taking _
he _ said _ what _ did _ you _ get _ a _ deal _ for _ bill _
and _ i _ told _ him _
he _ says _ somebody _ 's _ taking _ you _ for _ a _ ride _
and _ i _ said _ no _ somebody _ took _ me _ for _ a _ ride _ last _ saturday _
that _ 's _ right _
and E uh E uh E and _ i E i _ find _ that _ uh E
and _ for _ the _ longest _ time _ then _ i _ drove _ up _ to _ will _ 's _ point _
and E and _ the _ and _ the _ fellow _ died _ since _ then _
and E and _ some _ of _ his _ relatives _ have _ taken _ over _ the _ business _
and _ that _
but _
and _ since _ then _ i _ had _
uh _ our _ children _ are _ both _ uh _ basically _ adults _
they E we _ 've _ we _ 've _ got _ two _
uh _ one _ is _ twenty-one _
and _ one _ is _ twenty-five _
uh-huh _
and _ they E they _ still _ live _ at _ home _
uh-huh _
well E that E 's E that _ 's _ a _ little _ unusual _ for E uh E for _ children _ of _ that _ age _ to _ have _ both _ of _ them _ that _ age _ at _ home _
but _ uh _ i _ guess _ the _ activities _ that _ uh _ we _ have _ with _ them _ are _ uh _ pretty _ few _ and _ far _ between _
actually _ the E they _ 're _ both _ going _ on _ their _ own _ most _ of _ the _ time _
uh-huh _
so _ uh _ most _ of _ our _ activities _ are _ you _ know _ just _ discussion _ type _ things _ about _ what _ 's _ going _ on _ in _ the _ family _ and _ what _ they _ 're _ doing _ and _ that _ kind _ of _ thing _
uh-huh _
well _ we _ have _ a _ uh _ three _ year _ old _ and _ a _ one _ year _ old _
and E uh E so _ you _ know _ it _ keeps _ us _ pretty _ busy _ as _ you _ know _
sure _ it _ does _
and _ uh E most _ of _ the _ time _ with _ a _ three _ year _ old _ we _ 're _ trying _ to E to _ get _ him _ uh E
well E we _ play _ usually _ in _ the _ evening _ when E when _ i _ get _ home _ you _ know _ about _ five _ o'clock _ or _ so _ until _ about _ eight _ you _ know _ with _ the _ exception _ of _ dinner _
out _ in _ the _ front _ or _ backyard _ playing _ like E uh E tee _ ball _ off E the E you _ know _ off _ the _ ball _ and _ let _ him _ hit _ a _ lot _ of _ baseball _
uh _ since _ we _ just _ got _ here _ we _ got _ the _ uh _ uh _ new _ two _ wheel _ bike _ with _ training _ wheels _ on _ it _ for _ him _
and _ he _ really _ likes _ riding _ that _ around _
uh-huh _
oh _ yeah _
i _
so _ you _ know _
and _ trying _ to _ supervisor _ him _ with _ that _ and _ everything _ and _ uh _ playing _ squirt _ guns _ and _ all _ that _
he _ really _ likes _ that _
yeah _
and _ uh _ the _ one _ year _ old _ just _ kind _ of _ follows _ along _ and _ does _ everything _
trying _ to _ do _ everything _ he _ does _
yeah _
is _ the _ one _ year _ old _ a _ boy _
no _
it _ 's _ a _ girl _
a _ girl _
yeah _
ours E uh E the _ older _ one _ is _ a _ girl _
so _
and E the E and _ the _ younger _ one _ is _ a _ boy _
so _
yeah _
uh _ i _ guess _ uh _ what _ i _ see _ is _ so _ far _ as _ uh _ the _ trends _ uh _ uh _ for _ children _ uh _
i _ do _ n't _ know _ what _ kind _ of _ a _ area _ virginia _ beach _ is _
but _ of _ course _ uh _ richardson _ is _ in _ the _ dallas _ area _
uh-huh _
and _ i _ think _ uh _ the _ big _ city _ uh _
activities _ for E for _ children _ now _ are _
they _ 're _ good _
but _ there _ 's _ so _ much _ uh _ potential _ danger _ you _ know _
that _ you _ really _ have _ to _ watch _ your _ children _ so _ closely _ now _
that _ you _ ca _ n't _ let _ them _ grow _ up _ the E way E the _ way _ i _ grew _ up _ you _ know _
uh-huh _
i E i _ 'm _ from _ a _ smaller _ town _ in _ east _ texas _
and _ i _ could _ you _ know _ go _ and _ do _ whatever E pretty _ much _ whatever _ i _ wanted _ to _ do _ uh E my _ whole _ life _
uh-huh _
uh E you _ know _ i _ never E never _ had _ to _ worry _ about _ the _ bad _ guys _ being _ out _ there _
uh-huh _
and _ uh E you _ know _ i _ find _ it E 's E it _ 's _ quite _ a _ bit _ different _ now _
that _ uh _ you _ know _ you _ have _ to _ watch _ your _ children _ so _ closely _ and _ uh _ keep _ up _ with _ them _
i E i _ feel _ like _ uh E
that E it _ 's _ it _ 's _ really _ a _ sad _ commentary _ on _ uh E you _ know _ a _ life _ in _ general _
uh-huh _
that E uh E you _ know _ that _ children _ ca E n't E cannot _ be _ allowed _ to _ grow _ up _ uh E you _ know _ without _ really _ close _ supervision _
well E i E i _ agree _ with _ that _
and _ i E seem E i _ seem _ to _ feel _ the _ same _ way _ you _ know _
even _ just _ when _ i _ grew _ up _ and _ everything _
and E and _ the _ way _ it _ is _ now _ you _ get _ a _ lot _ of _ supervision _ is E is _ at _ hand _ and _ everything _
uh-huh _
uh _ the _ only _ other _ thing _ i _ have _ noticed _ though _ is _ that _ uh _ it _ seems _ that _ there _ 's _ been _ a _ lot _ of _ or _ more _ emphasis _ at _ least _ in _ what _ we _ 've _ been _ dealing _ with _
and E and _ the _ looking _ you _ know _
just _ start _ not _ even _
not _ really _ looking _ for _ a _ school _ for _ him _ but _ uh E like E a _ preschool _ or _ something _ that E where _ he _ would _ go _ maybe _ a _ couple _ hours _ a _ couple _ days _ a _ week _ or _ something _
uh-huh _
for E for _ a _ three _ year _ old _ it _ 's _ that _ uh E
there _ 's _ a _ lot _ of _ emphasis _ on E on _ on _ on _ education _ and _ what _ these _ children _ should _ know _ before _ they _ reach _ kindergarten _
right _
and E and _ it _ seems _ like _ it _ 's _ a _ lot _ more _ than _ they _ need _ to _ know _ and _ be _ able _ to _ do _ than _ when E we E are E the E when _ i _ had _ to _ go _ in _ kindergarten _
yeah _
and _ it _ seems _ like _ it _ 's _ more _ uh _
you _ know _ i _ do _ n't _ know _
they _ 're _ expecting _ more _ or E uh E or _ just _ uh E you _ know _
kids _ just _ because _ of _ the _ computer _ age _ or _ whatever _ it _ just _ know _ more _ when _ they _ get _ you _ know _ to _ be _ five _ or _ six _ or _ something _
yeah _
but _
um E i _ guess _ looking _ at E uh E back _ at _ at _ what _ our _ children _ did _ compared _ to _ what E uh E you _ know _ what _ i _ had _ to _ go _ through _ in _ school _
the E uh E there _ there _ does _ seem _ to _ be _ a _ lot _ more _ in _ the _ curriculum _
it _ 's _ a _ lot _ more _ complicated _
a _ lot _ more _ available _ of _ course _
uh-huh _
but _ uh _ this _
so _ much _ more _ to _ learn _ now _ that _ it _ really _ makes _ it _ more _ difficult _ i _ would _ think _
i E i _ would _ probably _ have _ a _ hard _ time _ getting _ through _ school _ myself _
uh-huh _
uh _ you _ know _ just _
or _ at _ least _ it _ would _ be _ a _ lot _ harder _ than _ it _ was _ when _ i _ went _ to _ school _
uh-huh _
one _ thing _ is _ i _ got _ a _ home _ computer _ too _
and _ uh _ i _ play _ uh _ with _ the _ three _ year _ old _
i _ play _ some _ computer _ games _ and _ stuff _ with _ him _
uh-huh _
educational _ games _ like _ you _ know _ concentration _ type _ games _ the _ matching _ things _ like _ that _
right _
yeah _
and _ uh E he E 's E he _ really _ likes _ it _
and E uh E and _ i _ think _ it _ 's _ important _ because _ i _ think _ that _ uh E you _ know _ it _ gives _ him _ the _ interaction _ with _ the _ computer _
because _ it _ sure _ looks _ like _ that _ 's _ going _ to _ be _ you _ know _ the _ big _ thing _ for _ a _ long _ time _
huh _
and _ given E given _ that _ knowledge _ and _ stuff _ with _ it _
yeah _
i _ think _ uh _
and _ he _ seems _ to _ enjoy _ it _
ery _ faint _ oh _
and _ uh E of _ course _ the _ one _ year _ old _ has E n't E has _ n't _ gotten _ there _ yet _
but _ uh _
and _ the _ other _ thing _ we _ try _ to _ do _ is E uh E since _ the _ here _ is _ uh E sign _ him _ up _ for _ and _ her _ for _ uh E different _ activities _ at _ like E the _ rec _ center _ or _ something _ like _ swimming _
right _
you _ know _ uh _
or _
there _ 's _ a _ little _ soccer _ thing _ that _ he _ 's _ going _ to _ do _ for _ a _ week _ or _ so _
and _ uh _ you _ know _
where _ they _ go _ for _ an _ hour _ or _ so _
yeah _
and _ uh _
because _ uh E when _ he _ was _ a _ baby _ that E we _ did _ the _ swimming _ too _
and _ he _ really _ liked _ it _
so _ we _ 're _ going _ to _ do _ that _ with _ our _ daughter _ too _
yeah _
that _ uh E uh E watching _ a _ little E little _ boys _ play _ soccer _ is E is _ more _ fun _
i _ ca _ n't _ imagine _ them _ having _ as _ much _ fun _ as _ the _ parents _ had _ watching _ them _
i _ know _
well _ we _ were _ just _ talking _ about _ that _ too _
and _ i _ guess _ it E 's E not E really E soccer E it _ 's _ just _ kind _ of _ a _ well E kick _ the _ ball _ around _ for _ a _ while _ see _ what _ happens _
right _
yeah _
the E the _ disorganized _ play _ really _ what _ it _ was _
but E but _ uh E
yeah _
yeah _
when _ ours _ was _ a _
he _
i _ guess _ he _ was _ probably _ five _ or _ six _ you _ know _ when _ he _ first _ started _ playing _ soccer _
uh-huh _
and E uh E and _ that E was E that _ was _ more _ fun _ to _ watch _ those _ boys _ trying E to E trying _ to _ kick _ the _ ball _ up _ and _ down _ the _ field _
uh-huh _
but _ uh _
and _ it _ 's _
i _ guess _ that _ was _ you _ know _ as E important E uh E as _ much _ important _ to _ the _ parents _ as _ it _ was _ to _ the _ children _ that E uh E you _ know _ to _ get _ out _ and _ watch _ the _ kids _ play _
so _
uh-huh _
i _ guess _ one _ of _ the _ things _ that _ i _ think _ about _ is _ a _ talking _ about _ education _ uh E i _ kind _ of _ feel _ like E uh E that _ uh E the E the _ school _ systems _ in E this E particularly _ in _ this _ area _ the _ systems _ are _ not _ under _ enough _ control _
the E the _ students _ have _ a E little E too E much E uh E too _ much _ leeway _
uh-huh _
excuse _ me _
um E and E the E and _ that _ 's _ kind _ of _ contradictory _ to _ what _ i _ said _
but _ you _ know _ you _
the _
you _ have _ to _ be _ under _ control _ so _ much _ when _ they _ 're _ out _
but _ when _ they _ 're _ in _ school _ they E they _ do _ n't _ have _ quite E quite _ as _ much _ control _ over _ them _ as E uh E as _ what _ i _ would _ liked _ to _ have _ seen _
right _
right _
right _
uh-huh _
uh E uh E i _ kind _ of _ feel _ like _ there E 's E there _ 's _ too _ much _ allowed _ to _ go _ on _ in E at _ at _ school _
uh-huh _
and _ uh E you _ know _ it _ tends _ to E uh E to _ encourage _ students _ to E not E be E as E you _ know _ to _ not _ concentrate _ as _ much _ on _ the _ education _
uh-huh _
you _ know _ they E 're E they _ 're _ there _ for _ a _ good _ time _
right _
and _ you _ know _ to E to _ see _ how _ little _ they _ can _ get _ by _ with _
uh-huh _
well E i _ know _ of _ number _ of _ people _ that _ are _ in E the E in _ the _ uh E school _ district _ down _ in E in _ uh E san _ antonio _
and _ uh _ it _ seems _ like _ it _ 's _
a _ lot _ of _ the _ problem _ is _ to _ you _ know _
you _ always _ have _ the _ lack _ of _ funds _
but _ it _ seems _ to _ be _ getting _ worse _ and _ worse _
and _ so _ they _ do _ n't _ settle _ the _ resources _ to _ draw _ on _ to _ give _ as _ much _ supervision _ as E as _ as _ kids _ need _
right _
and _ uh E you _ know _ that _ 's _ just _ a _ problem _ that _ who _ knows _ how _ that E 's E going E to E that _ 's _ going _ to _ come _ out _ or _ anything _
but _ uh _
but _
ery _ faint _ yeah _
but _ uh E i E i _ do _ n't _ i _ do _ n't _ know _
i _ think _ uh E you _ know _ some _ of _ the _ thing _ has _ to _ do _ with E uh E with _ the _ civil _ rights _ program _
not _ that _ the _ civil _ rights _ program _ is _ bad _
but _ that _ there _ 's _
it _ carried _ over _ into _ you _ know _ individual _ rights _
uh-huh _
and _ it _ you _ know _ trickled _
well _ tom _ just _ tonight _ i _ was _ working _ on _ my _ car _ out _ of _ necessity _
and _ i _ had E uh E uh E had _ a _ long _ age-old _ problem _ of _ my _ bright _ lights _ not _ working _
uh E this _ is _ the _ type _ of _ uh E switch _ where _ you _ flip _ the E the _ lever _ the _ turn _ signal _ on _ the _ column _
yeah _
and _ when _ i _ would _ uh _ put _ it _ in _ the _ bright _ light _ position _ the _ lights _ would _ go _ out _ completely _
which _ is _ even _ worse _ than _ them _ just _ not _ getting _ bright _
exactly _
and _ i _ had _ presumed _ that _ it _ was _ the _ switch _
and _ uh _ this _ is _ uh _ an _ older _ car _
it _ 's _ a _ seventy-two _ m _ g _
so _ i _ had _ to _ mail _ order _ the _ part _ uh _
which _ i _ had _ done _
and _ tonight _ i _ went _ out _ and _ uh E at _ least _ hooked _ in _ the _ new _ part _ only _ to _ discover _ that E that _ apparently _ is _ not _ the _ problem _
it _ 's _ not _ in _ the _ switch _ because _ it _ does _ the _ same _ thing _ with _ the _ new _ switch _
oh _
so _ i _ 'll _ be _ faced _ with _ having _ to _ return _ that _ product _ and _ uh E hoping _ that E uh E you _ know _ that _ they _ will _ accept _ it _
although _ it _ 's _ been _ removed _ from _ the _ box _ it _ 's _ obviously _ not _ been _ really _ used _
did _ you _ do _ the _ diagnosis _ or _ was _ it _ just _ an _ assumption _ that _ that _ 's _ probably _ the _ part _ that _ failed _
uh _ i _ had _ done _ what _ diagnosis _ i _ could _ primarily _ by _ looking _ at _ a _ wiring _ diagram _ that _ i _ did _ have _ of _ the _ car _ and _ uh _ pretty _ much _ decided _ that _ that _ had _ to _ be _ the _ problem _
uh-huh _
i _ talked _ to _ one _ mechanic _ about _ it _
and _ he _ suspected _ the _ switch _ also _
uh _ but _ i _ 've _ not _ you _ know _
i _ really _ do _ n't _ know _ what _ the _ problem _ might _ be _
it E it _ the _ other _ switch _ could _ be _ the _ main _ switch _ itself _ uh E that _ turns _ the _ lights _ on _ or _ off _ which _ is _ on _ the _ dashboard _
uh-huh _
uh _ it _ might _ be _ tied _ into _ the _ equation _ somehow _
but _
yeah _ i _ know _
uh E when _ working _ with _ the _ uh E flashers _ there _ is _ uh E usually _ a E a _ special _ fuse _ that _ operates _ the _ flashers _
do _ you _ have _ a _ separate _ fuse _ for _ your _ high _ beam _ as _ opposed _ to _ your _ low _ beam _
i E i _ do _ n't _ know _
i _ should _ look _ at _ that _
i _ do _ n't _ remember _ seeing _ one _ in E the E uh E in _ the _ diagram _
diagram _
so _ i _ 'll _ have _ to _ go _ back _ and _ look _ at _ that _
yeah _
i _ do _ n't _ even _ know _ if _ my _ current _ cars _ have _ a _ separate _ fuse _
i _ know _ sometimes _ when _ you _ think _ there _ are _ things _ running _ while _ they _ 're _ at _ the _ same _ unit _ like _ the _ headlamp _
uh-huh _
you _ tend _ to _ think _ well _ there _ 's _ one _ fuse _ operating _ the _ whole _ thing _
but _ sometimes _ the _ extra _ amperage _ that _ a _ high _ beam _ drives _ as _ opposed _ to _ a _ low _ beam _ requires _ uh E the _ use _ of E a E of _ a E maybe _ a _ higher _ fuse _
yeah _
that _ 's _ a _ good _ idea _
so _ that _ 's _ a _ possibility _
what _ i _ 've _ typically _ found _ when _ that _ uh _
companies _ are _ pretty _ good _ about _ accepting _ returns _ on _ products _ like _ that _ when _ they _ 're _ not _ needed _ after _ all _
and _ i _ hope _ that _ that _ 's _ the _ case _ this _ time _
is _ this _ a E a _ mail _ order _ parts _ house _ that _ specializes _ in E in _ parts _ for _ parts _ for _ uh E old _ imports _
right _
exactly _
who _
it _ 's _ out _ of _ kansas _ somewhere _
um _
so _ it _ 's _ not _ j _ c _ whitney _ or _ somebody _ like _ that _
no _
it _ 's _ not _
i _ also _ got _ a _ piece _ of _ chrome _ for _ the E the _ hood _ that _ they _ had _ indicated _ was _ the _ right _ part _ for _ this _ car _
but _ it _ is _ not _ either _
it _ 's _ obviously _ does _ n't _ quite _ fit _
so _ it _ must _ be _ for _ a _ different _ year _
so _ i _ 'll _ have _ to _ try _ to _ return _ that _ as _ well _
yeah _
have _ you _ found _ any _ uh _ uh _ reliable _ import _ service _ people _ in _ the _ metroplex _
well _ i _ had _ one _ person _ that _ i _ used _ for _ years _ and _ years _ on _ this _ car _
because _ i _ 've _ owned _ this _ car _ since _ it _ was _ new _
and _ uh _
but _ it _ 's _ over _ like _ in _ the _ brook _ hollow _ industrial _ district _ down _ on _ stemmons _ and _ inwood _ area _
oh _ yeah _
uh-huh _
and _ i _ had _ n't _ used _ him _ for _ some _ years _
and _ the _ last _ time _ i _ called _ him _ back _ it _ turned _ out _ that _ he _ had _ further _ specialized _
instead _ of _ uh _ all _ import _ cars _ he _ has _ narrowed _ it _ down _ to _ where _ he _ only _ works _ on _ uh _ german _ cars _ and _ ause _ german _ cars _
i _ 'll _ be _ darned _
i _ 'm _ not _ sure _ that _ he _ works _ on _ much _ else _ at _ all _
but _ he _ does _ n't _ work _ on _ british _ cars _ any _ more _ and _ gave _ me _ the _ name _ of _ somebody _ else _ to _ take _ a _ look _ at _ it _
so _ uh _ uh _ i _ may _ have _ to _ check _ with _ that _ person _
as _ it _ turns _ out _ that E one E that _ shop _ is _ near _ where _ i _ now _ work _
so _ i E 'll E uh E i _ should _ be _ able _ to _ take _ it _ in _ and _ check _ that _ part _ out _
i _ 've _ not _ had _ to _ exchange _ any _ other _ parts _ recently _ because _ they _ were _ defective _
now E i _ 've _ had E had _ pretty _ good _ luck _
i _ just _ however _ did _ uh E have _ to _ get _ a E a _ uh E one _ of _ these _ jam _ box _ portable _ dual _ cassette _ players _ uh E repaired _
uh-huh _
i _ purchased _ it _ at _ sam _ 's _
and _ i _ had _ assumed _ that _ it _ had _ a _ ninety _ day _ warranty _
and _ i _ should _ have _ checked _ more _ carefully _ and _ done _ a _ better _ job _ of _ saving _ the _ receipt _
because _ i _ did _ n't _ take _ it _ in _ right _ away _ and _ let _ a _ whole _ year _ go _ by _
uh _ some _ of _ the _ buttons _ did _ n't _ work _ right _ where _ you _ had _ to _ actually _ physically _ hold _ them _ down _ to _ get _ it _ to _ record _ or _ to _ play _
and _ as _ it _ turned _ out _ it _ had _ a _ full _ year _ 's _ warranty _
and _ i _ could _ have _ gotten _ it _ repaired _ for _ free _
but _ i _ had _ to _ take _ it _ in _
oh _ my _ goodness _
while _ it _ was _ in _ the _ shop _ i _ ended _ up _ finding _ the _ receipt _ that _ i _ thought _ had _ long _ since _ been _ lost _
uh E but _ it _ did _ n't _ do _ me _ any _ good _ because _ i E had E i _ had _ missed _ the _ window _ by _ about _ a _ week _ or _ two _
oh _ no _
so _ i E did E n't E even E i _ did _ n't _ really _ uh E even _ bring _ it _ up _ when _ i _ went _ in _ to _ pick _ it _ up _
but _ uh _ that _ 's _ really _ my _ only _ experience _ in _ the _ past _ year _ where _ i _ 've _ had _ to _ take _ a _ product _ back _ because _ of _ a _ defect _
well _ ours _ was _ n't _ within _ the _ last _ year _
i _ guess _ it _ 's _ been _ within _ the _ last _ two _ years _ uh _
judy _ has _ an _ oldsmobile _ that _ we _ bought _ new _
and _ it _ 's _ one _ with _ the _ uh _ electronic _ ignition _ and _ the _ computer _ controlled _ mixer _ and _ uh _
i _ do _ n't _ know _ what _ else _ it _ all _ controls _ but _ the _ fuel _ mixture _ and _ cruise _ control _ and _ things _ of _ that _ sort _
and _ we _ found _ that _ the E uh E uh E we _ were _ having _ two _ problems _
it _ was _ idling _ fast _ when _ you _ first _ started _ the _ engine _ to _ the _ point _ that _ we _ park _ on _ a _ hill _ under _ our _ car _ port _
and _ it E when _ you _ first _ dropped _ it _ into _ geared _ it _ would _ immediately _ want _ to _ back _ up _ into _ the _ alley _
and _ knowing _ that _ you _ always _ had _ to _ keep _ your _ foot _ on _ the _ brake _ hard _
otherwise _ it _ would _ just _ wrench _ control _ away _ from _ you _
good _ grief _
and _ the _ other _ problem _ judy _ would _ have _ is _ occasionally _ she _ would _ uh _ be _ driving _ along _ uh _ decelerating _ like _ coming _ to _ a _ stop _ sign _ but _ not _ yet _ stopped _ at _ the _ stop _ sign _
uh-huh _
and _ the _ engine _ would _ just _ quit _
so _ we _ took _ it _ back _ to _ the _ uh _ oldsmobile _ place _ and _ asked _ them _ to _ check _ it _ out _
and _ at _ first _ they _ thought _ it _ was _ just _ a _ matter _ of _ timing _
so _ they _ adjusted _ timing _
and _ the _ problem _ did _ n't _ go _ away _
so _ we _ ended _ up _ taking _ it _ back _ again _
and _ i _ do _ n't _ know _ why _ they _ do _ n't _ look _ at _ these _ things _ the _ first _ time _ around _
but _ the _ second _ time _ around _ they _ looked _ at _ their _ uh _ recall _ service _ and _ their _ service _ reports _ from _ region _ or _ headquarters _ whatever _
and E and _ they _ had _ a _ description _ of _ the _ exact _ problem _ we _ were _ experiencing _ that _ apparently _ was _ a _ programming _ error _ in _ the _ uh E computer _ control _ unit _
huh _
which _ fortunately _ they _ replaced _ under _ warranty _ because _ it _ was _ about _ a _ three _ hundred _ or _ three _ hundred _ and _ fifty _ dollar _ part _
my _ goodness _
and E uh E so _ once _ they _ replaced _ it _ then _ the E the _ car _ seemed _ to _ work _ fine _ for _ a _ considerable _ period _ of _ time _
huh _
and _ now _ it _ seems _ to _ be _
we E we _ 're _ not _ experiencing _ the _ stalling _
but _ we _ 're _ still _ experiencing _ a _ very _ uneven _
okay _
what _ do _ you _ think _ about _ it _
uh _ well _ immigration _
i _ know _ they _ 're _ really _ strict _ right _ now _ because _ my _ husband _ is _ from _ out _ of _ the _ country _
and _ uh E we _ had _ to _ go _ through _ a _ whole _ very _ long _ process _ to E uh E to _ assure _ the _ government _ that _ he _ was _ uh E marrying _ me _ and _ not _ to _ be _ a _ resident _ here _
uh-huh _
that _ 's _
yeah _
i E think E that E 's E uh E i _ think _ it _ 's _ a _ little _ crazy _
i _ worked _ with _ spanish _ people _ for _ about _ two _ years _
uh-huh _
and _ just _ it _ was _ incredible _ to _ me _ to _ see _ the _ things _ that _ they _ had _ to _ go _ through _ when _ they _ were _ really _ some _ of _ the _ best _ workers _
yeah _
that _ 's _ true _
i _ mean _ you _ ca _ n't _ just _ come _ over _ to _ the _ country _ because _ uh _ you _ want _ to _
right _
you _ know _ that _ 's _ not _ good _ enough _
you _ have E to E have E a E have _ to _ have _ a _ darn _ good _ reason _ of _ political _ or _ whatever _
right _
exactly _
not E a E good E not _ a _ good _ easy _ way _ to _ get _ in _
yeah _
i E think E you _ know _ i _ think _ in _ a _ lot _ of _ ways _ the _ law _ is _ good _ because _ it _ tries _ to E to _ protect _ you _ know _ the _ people _ who _ are _ in _ the _ states _
exactly _
my _ mother _ uh _ actually _ knew _ a _ woman _ in _ another _ state _ that _ used _ to _ marry _ men _ just _
uh-huh _
she _ 'd _ never _ even _ meet _ them _
and _ she _ 'd _ just _ get _ money _ for _ it _
oh _ you _ 're _ kidding _
huh-uh _
so _
sounds _ like _ a _ lot _ of _ fun _
yeah _
it _ 's _ amazing _ to _ me _ how E how _ many _ things _ they _ would _ allow _ to _ occur _ before _ you _ know _ you _ can _ come _ in _
exactly _
but _ i _ mean _ with _ the _ new _ laws _ it E 's E it _ 's _ tough _ now _
right _
yeah _
it _ 's _ kind _ of _ frustrating _ too _ for _ those _ who _ are _ legitimate _ now _
exactly _
you _ know _ i _ think _
well _ and _ you _ know _ uh _ my _ grandparents _ came _ to _ this _ country _ just _ wanting _ a _ better _ life _ you _ know _
uh-huh _
and _ they _ got _ here _
but _ now _ it E 's E a E you _ know _ it _ 's _ so _ strict _ that _ you _ ca _ n't _ just _ do _ that _
right _
exactly _
and _ i _ think _ it _ 's _ important _ that _ they E you _ know _ they _ allow _ a _ good _ number _ of _ people _ in _ every _ year _
because _ really _ they _ 're _ the _ ones _ who _ work _ the _ hardest _ and _ do _ the _ jobs _ that E that _ we _ do _ n't _ want _ to _ do _
i _ agree _
and _ i _ just _
i _ do _ n't _ know _
i E have E personally _ i _ have _ a _ problem _ with _ it _
i _ think _ that _ you _ know _ if _ someone _ wants _ to _ come _ in _ and _ they _ can _ prove _ that _ they _ 're _ going _ to _ work _ and _ they _ 're _ going _ to _ be _ a _ good _ citizen _ that _ we _ should _ n't _ close _ our _ door _
exactly _
if _ they _ 're _ not _ going _ to _ be _ on _ welfare _ or E or _ or _ whatever _
they _ 're _ going _ to _ be _ a _ productive _ citizen _ zen _
and _ you _ know _ i E i _ believe _ that _ if _ someone _ goes _ on _ welfare _ that _ 's _ when _ you _ you _ know _ send _ them _ back _ to _ their _ country _
yeah _
and _ i _ think _ a _ lot _ of _ times _ we _ 're _ so _ busy _ trying _ to _ keep _ them _ out _ that _ we _ 're _ spending _ twice _ as _ much _ money _ as _ we _ would _ just _ allowing _ them _ in _
and _
well E think _ of _ how _ many _ illegal _ aliens _ have E have _ have _ been _ uh E uh E sent _ back _ to _ mexico _ just _ to _ find _ their _ way _ back _
yeah _
and _ that E 's E that _ 's _ what _ i _ think _
you _ know _ i E i _ have _ to _ laugh _
because _ like _ i _ said _ i _ worked _ with _ a _ lot _ of _ those _
and _ they _ 'd _ been _ deported _ two _ or _ three _ times _
and _ just _ basically _ what _ they _ do _ is _ they _ get _ caught _ when _ they _ wanted _ to _ go _ home _ for _ christmas _ or _ for _ any _ other _ time _
that _ 's _ right _
that _ 's _ our _ money _
yes _
that _ 's _ true _
but _ i E think E you _ know _ i _ think _ all _ in _ all _ there _ 's _ a _ lot _ of _ improvements _
i _ think _ the _ general _ idea _ is _ good _
but E but _ there _ could _ be _ some _ work _ done _ in _ the _ area _
i E i _ think _
i E i _ agree _
well _ good _
anyway E do _ you _ have _ anything _ else _ in _ the E the _ subject _ uh E that _ you _ might _ want _ to _ talk _ about _
uh _ i _ uh _
boy _
this _ is _ spur _ of _ the _ moment _ uh _
but _ i E i _ do _ n't _ really _ see _ any E any _ changes _ that _ i _ think _ of _ really _ blatant _ right _ now _
other _ than _ i _ think _ they _ ought _ to _ take _ you _ know _ on _ a _ case _ by _ case _ basis _ and _ not _ necessarily _ make _ it _ a _ uh _ political _ refugee _
yeah _
absolutely _
i _ think _ a _ lot _ of _ times _ we _ take _ you _ know _ basically _ who _ we _ want _ to _
because _ if E you E if _ you _ have _ connections _ it _ 's _ a _ lot _ easier _ to _ get _ in _
exactly _
connections _ and _ money _
yeah _
and _ i _ think _ you _ know _ it _ should _ be _ more _ of _ a _ thing _ that _ 's _ based _ upon _ someone _ 's _ intent _ you _ know _ and _ that _ it _ should _ be _ equal _ to _ all _
yeah _
and _ then _ not _ like _ the _ united _ states _
basically _ it _ 's _ not _ who _ you _ know _
it E it _ does _ n't _ become _ a _ thing _ of _ who _ you _ know _ but E but _ how _ the _ type _ of _ person _ you _ are _
i _ agree _
and _ it _ should _ be _ based _ on _ those _ kinds _ of _ things _ so _ the _ good _ people _ like _ probably _ your _ husband _ can _ get _ in _
yeah _
well _ we _ got _ him _ past _ that _
but _ uh _
well _ great _
i _ know _ there _ 's _ a _ lot _ of _ other _ people _ out _ there _ would _ probably _ do _ a _ good _ job _ here _
yep _
well _ let _ 's _ see _
is _ there _ anything _ i _ believe _ in _
i _ think _ that _ 's _ it _
is _ this _ like _ a _ very _ short _ call _
no _
i _ 'm _ not _ sure _ how _ long _ they _ 're _ supposed _ to _ be _
but _ i _ 've _ enjoyed _ it _
it _ 's _ good _ hearing _ your E your _ point _ of _ view _
and _ i _ think _ that _ 's _ neat _
i _ think _ we _ agree _ a _ lot _ on _ that _
and _ i _ 've _ learned _ something _ from _ it _
i _ did _ too _
well _ it _ was _ nice _ talking _ to _ you _
well _ thanks _
i _ 'm _ glad _ you _ 're _ home _
you _ have _ a _ good _ evening _ all _ right _
you _ too _
thanks _
bye-bye _
bye _
well E seems _ to _ me _ the E one _ of _ the _ reasons _ that _ people _ do _ n't _ go _ out _ to _ vote _ is _ maybe _ they _ 're _ bored _ with _ the _ whole _ election _ process _
well _ i _ agree _ with _ the _ boredom _ of _ the _ election _ process _
but _ i _ also _ uh _ think _ that _ people _ do _ n't _ realize _ that _ their _ boat _ vote _ will _ make _ a _ difference _
uh _ they _ feel _ like _ that _ you _ know _ it _ 's _ going _ to _ go _ however _ it _ 's _ going _ to _ go _
and _ their _ one _ little _ vote _ is _ not _ going _ to _ make _ that _ much _ difference _
and _ it _ 's _ just _ why _ make _ the _ effort _
well _ sometimes _ strangely _ enough _ one _ vote _ has _ made _ the _ difference _
well _ i _ agree _ with _ that _
and E i E and _ i _ do _ know _ that _ you _ know _ all _ those _ votes _ are _ counted _
and E and _ they _ do _ make _ a _ difference _
uh E also _ i _ think _ that _ people _ have _ a _ tendency _ to E to _ vote _ in _ the _ larger _ elections _ and _ not _ vote _ in _ the E the _ more _ local _ elections _
well _ it _ 's _ kind _ of _ strange _
because _ in _ the _ local _ elections _ is _ the _ ones _ that _ have _ the _ most _ influence _ on _ their _ day-to-day _ lives _
exactly _
and _ i E i _ even _ have _ a _ tendency _ to _ do _ that _ myself _
and _ i _ have _ to _ really _ make _ a _ concerted _ effort _ to E to _ get _ involved _
i E live E i _ live _ in _ a _ suburb _ in _ mesquite _
and E uh E so _ i _ really _ have _ to _ make _ an _ effort _ to _ read _ the _ local _ paper _ and _ to _ see _ what _ 's _ going _ to _ because _ that _ directly _ affects _ me _
but _ i E i _ think _ on _ the _ whole _ most _ people _ do _ n't _ uh E feel _ that _ way _
or _ do _ n't _ look E even _ look _ at _ that _
i _ think _ they _ just _ do _ n't _ even _
i E i _ do _ n't _ think _ they _ 're _ conscious _ of _ it _
well E maybe _ part _ of _ the _ problem _ is _ they E do E n't E they _ think _ they _ have _ enough _ choices _
well _ that _ may _ be _ true _ too _
i _ had _ n't _ thought _ of _ that _
you _ know _ in _ some _ of _ the _ european _ countries _ they _ have _ numbers _ of _ parties _ that _ run _
and _ then _ lot _ of _ more _ voters _ come _ out _ to _ vote _ than _ vote _ in _ this _ country _
uh-huh _
right _
and _ sometimes _ it _ 's _ uh _
well _ not _ sometimes _ but _ many _ times _ it _ 's _ who _ has _ the _ most _ money _ to _ spend _ on _ the _ largest _ campaign _
and E and _ issues _ get _ uh E bogged _ down _
well _ maybe _ it _ 's _ a _ matter _ of _ you _ know _ voter _ awareness _
uh _ i _ think _ voter _ awareness _
i E i _ did _ some _ work _ for _ the _ uh E women _ 's _ league _ of _ uh E voters _ uh E several _ years _ ago _
and _ i _ think _ there _ are _ some _ organizations _ that _ used _ to _ uh _ do _ some _ voter _ awareness _ uh _ things _
they _ do _ n't _ get _ a _ lot _ of _ participation _
they _ do _ n't _ get _ a _ lot _ of _ uh _ activity _
most _ of _ the _ league _ of _ women _ voters _ what _ they _ did _ was _ they _ put _ out _ information _ so _ that _ it E it _ would _ just _ be _ made _ available _ to _ everyone _
now _ other _ areas _ that _ i _ 've _ worked _ in _ like _ in _ the _ chambers _ they _ would _ just _ have _ the _ candidates _ come _
and _ it _ would _ just _ you _ know _
that _ was _ not _ a _ lot _ of _ community _ involvement _
and _ those _ were _ people _ that _ would _ mostly _ vote _ anyway _
well _ i _ think _ part _ of _ the _ problem _ is _ the _ election _ goes _ on _ way _ too _ long _
in _ britain _ you _ know _ they _ have _ a _ set _ period _ of _ time _
and E and _ for _ campaign _ that _ 's _ it _
in _ this _ country _ it _ seems _ like _ it _ 's _ a _ continuous _ ongoing _ campaign _
it E 's E a E it _ 's _ an _ ongoing _ campaign _
and _ it _ 's _ expensive _ campaign _
and _ it E it _ uh E eliminates _ a _ lot _ of _ qualified _ people _
uh _ maybe _ more _ qualified _ and _ uh _ more _ dedicated _ to _ the _ issues _
well E the E they _ do _ n't _ want _ to _ spend _ the _ time _
or _ they _ do _ n't _ have _ the _ money _
exactly _
exactly _
and _ it E it _
i E i _ ca _ n't _ i _ just _ ca _ n't _ believe _
i E 've E i _ 've _ worked _ in _ a _ couple _ of _ local _ campaigns _
i _ just _ cannot _ believe _ the _ dollars _ that _ are _ spent _ just E even _ locally _
well _ it _ 's _ a _ matter _ of _ name _ recognition _
people _ are _ n't _ going _ to _ vote _ for _ someone _ they _ 've _ never _ heard _ of _
oh _ well _ i _ agree _ with _ that _
but _ also _
and E i E and _ i _ 'm _ not _ for _ controlling _ how _ much _ is _ spent _
but _ do _ you _ know _
that _ 's _ one _ thing _
if E a E if _ the _ time _ was _ n't _ so _
if _ it _ was _ n't _ such _ a _ long _ uh _ campaigning _ time _ then _ they _ could _ n't _ spend _ as _ much _ money _
and _ even _ debates _ do _ n't _ seem _ to _ help _ much _
no _
they _ really _ do _ n't _
uh E it E 's E it _ 's _ a _ lot _ of _ it _ is _ who _ looks _ the _ best _ who E uh E who _ happens _ to _ say _ the _ right _ thing _ at _ the _ right _ time _ who E not E who _ may _ not _ be _ the _ most _ qualified _ and _ can _ get _ the E uh E the _ job _ done _
so _ we _ 're _ really _ voting _ for _ the _ best _ makeup _ person _ and _ the _ best _ handlers _
exactly _
and _ it E 's E a E it _ 's _ a _ lot _
i _ 've _ worked _ in _ public _ relations _ a _ lot _
and _ uh _ that _ kind _ of _ thing _ can _ make _ and _ break _ make _ or _ break _ you _
well _ that _ was _ certainly _ a _ media _ event _
and _ it _ 's _ just _ uh _ uh _
he _ possibly _ could _ have _ uh E won _ that _ election _ had _ it _ not _ been _ for _ some _ of _ the E the _ uh E the _ way _ he _ presented _ himself _
well _ he _ had _ a _ classic _ case _ of _ hoof _ in _ mouth _ disease _
hoof E is E is _ i _ guess _ the _ right _ term _ for _ him _
okay _
uh _ go _ ahead _
what _ are _ we _ supposed _ to _ discuss _ again _
aids _ research _ is _ something _ that E that _ i _ think _ whether _ our _ country _ is _ putting _ enough _ money _ into _ it _
more _ money _  _
and _ actually _ i _ 'm _ concerned _ that _ they _ 're _ not _
i _ have _ a _ friend _ who E is E working E with E uh E who _ works _ with _ uh E travel _ groups _
uh-huh _
and _ one _ of _ the _ ones _ that _ he _ 's _ worked _ with _ was _ professionals _ who _ came _ in _ for _ an _ aids _ uh _ conference _ in _ uh _ california _
uh-huh _
and _ these _ were _ from _ other _ people _ from _ other _ countries _
he _ 's _ a _ translator _
uh-huh _
and _ in _ talking _ to _ the _ people _ from _ france _ he _ said _ you _ know _
he _ says _ one _ of _ the _ things _ that _ really _ concerns _ me _ is _ your _ government _ is _ not _ telling _ you _ enough _ about _ how _ it _ and _ frightening _ this _ epidemic _ is _
and _ they _ 're _ letting _ the _ information _ out _ slowly _ about _ how E you _ know _ how _ big _ it _ is _
huh _
which _ is _ scary E you _ know _ pretty _ scary _ when _ so _ many _ people _ get _ it _
so _ i _ guess _ i E 'm E i _ 'm _ i _ 'd _ like _ to _ see _ us _ spend _ more _
i _ do _ n't _ know _ that _ spending _ more _ always _ gets _ it _
yeah _
i E 'm E i _ 'm _ ambivalent _ about _ it _ because _ um E uh E well E it _ is _ very _ frightening _ and _ scary _
i _ have _ no _ perspective _ on _ how _ it _ relates _ to _ other _ diseases _
and _ uh _ i _ mean _ whether _
you _ mean _ more _ money _ for _ that _ means _ less _ for _ cancer _ or _
yes _
yeah _
and _ uh _ whether _ those _ diseases _ can _
some _ difference _ could _ be _ made _ if _ you _ did _ pour _ more _ money _ in _ like _ diabetes _ research _
uh-huh _
uh _
uh-huh _
did _ n't _ uh _ you _ know _
but _ i _ uh _
then _ part _ of _ it _ 's _ lack _ of _ education _
i _ do _ n't _ know _ whether E whether _ you _ know _ where _ our _ money _ would _ be _ most _ effectively _ spent _
well _ it _
i E i _ agree _ with _ you _ there _
because _ i _ know _ every _ time _ that _ something _ comes _ into _ vogue _ all _ the _ money _ goes _ to _ that _ one _
and _ you _ do _ n't _ know _ whether _ it _ 's _ still _ also _ going _ to _ the _ other _ or _ if _ it _ 's _ a _ limited _ pie _
uh-huh _
money _ from _ money _ for _ taking _ care _ of _ the _ infants _ takes _ money _ away _ from _ taking _ care _ of _ the _ elderly _
or _ do _ they _ both _ get _ served _
uh _ that _ 's _ a _ good _ point _
and _ i E 'm E i _ am _ concerned _ a _ lot _ about _ uh E i _ 'm _ concerned _ about _ uh E two _ things _
one _ is _ preventing _ the _ spread _
and _ the _ other _ is _ for E uh E for _ uh E treating _ the _ illness _
uh-huh _
and _ i _ 'm _ not _ certain _
i E i _
again _ this _
i _ 'm _ telling _ you _
basically _ i _ do _ n't _ have _ any _ opinion _
uh-huh _
but _ whether _ or _ not _ it E would E be E uh E our _ money _ would _ be _ better _ spent _ uh E teaching E you _ know _ working _ on _ the _ drug _ problems _ and E the E and _ the _ sex _ problems _ uh E rather _ than _ trying _ to _ cure _ the _ people _ that _ already _ have _ it _
well _ and _ one _ of _ the _ things _ i _ 'd _
and _ i _ 'm _ with _ you _ that _ i _ do _ n't _ know _ is E is _ that _ really _ the _ only _ way _ it _ 's _ being _ transmitted _ or _ was _ that _ the _ easier _ way _ to _ tell _ us _ and _ we _ 're _ going _ to _ find _ out _ more _
yeah _
well _ you _ know _
that E 's E that _ 's _ the _ part _ that _
t- _ whether _ my _ dentist _ or _
that _ 's _ the _ part _ that _ scares _ me _ you _ know _
i _ mean _ beginning _ with _ this E is E this _ is _ just _ for _ homosexuals _
well _ no _
it _ 's _ for _ homosexuals _ and _ gays _
well _ no _
actually _ it _ 's _
i _ mean _ you _ know _
did _ they _ know _ that _ all _ along _
and _ i _ heard _ something _ the _ other _ day _ this _ sounds _ ridiculous _ about _ mosquitoes _
and _ you _ know _ they _ 've _ been _ saying _ oh _ no _ absolutely _ not _
ca _ n't _ get _ it _ from _ mosquitoes _
and E uh E and _ now _ they _ are _ saying _ well E maybe _ in _ the _ right _ conditions _
yes _
oh _
and _ i _ do _ n't _ know _ that _ 's _ true _ or _ not _
i _ mean _ i _ just _ heard _ it _ in _ passing _
but _ so _ what _ does _ that _
right _
what _ does _ that _ mean _ for _ people _ that _ you _ work _ with _ and _ shake _ hands _ with _ and _
and _ how _ is _ it _ really _ transmitted _ et _ cetera _
yeah _
which E is E i _ think _ what _ they _ also _ do _ n't _ know _
i _ mean _ that _ 's _
i _ think _ they E they _ told _ us _ what _ was _ convenient _ and _ felt _ safe _ to _ say _ you _ know _
uh-huh _
it _ was _ nice _ to _ isolate _ it _ to _ one _ particular _ community _ that _ they _ have _ trouble _ you _ know _ they _ just _ as _ soon _ not _ approve _ of _ anyway _
but E but _ that _ is _ n't _ how _ it _ was _ in _ africa _
no _
in _ africa _ was _ the _ men _ and _ women _ and E and _ had _ nothing _ to _ do _ with _ that _
and _ it _ 's _ huge _ over _ there _
so _ i E i _ you _ know _
and _ it _ 's _ beginning _ other _ countries _
that _ 's _ what _ 's _ his _ point _
this _ was _ an _ international _ conference _ where _ people _ are _ saying _ well _ but _ in _ my _ country _ it _ 's _ you _ know _ like _ this _
uh-huh _
and _ does _ that _ mean _ like _ flus _ and _ everything _ else _ there _ are _ all _ these _ different _ strains _ of _ it _
oh _
i _ mean _ i _ do _ n't _ know _
all _ i _ 'm _ saying _ is _ i _ think _ it _ 's _ scarier _ than _ we _ know _
uh _ or _ maybe _ they _ understand _ but _
i _ think _ maybe _ more _ information _ should _ be _ given _ out _ about _ it _
yeah _
and E uh E and _ then _ the _ people _ that _ have _ it _
it _ does _ seem _ that _ there _ are E are _ some _ drugs _ that _ are _ there _ that _ you _ know _ they _ keep _ holding _ back _
if E you E if _ i _ were _ dying _ i _ 'm _ not _ sure _ i _ would _ care _
i E i _ give _ me _ cyanide _
i _ mean _ is _ it _  _
yeah _
right _
i _ 'll _ take _ anything _ you _ know _
uh-huh _
i _ mean _ if E i E 'm E dying E if _ i _ know _ i _ 'm _ dying _ you _ can _ experiment _ on _ me _
ri- _
exactly _
go _ ahead _
and _ why E ca E n't E you E why _ ca _ n't _ the _ f _ d _ a _ say _ you _ know _ if _ these _ people _ knowingly _ consent _ to _ be _ research _ monkeys _ and _ well E let _ them _
exactly _
let _ them _ do _ it _
yeah _
yeah _
and _ that _ 's _ what _ i _ think _ they _ 're _ saying _ too _
have _ you _ had _ any _ snow _ up _ your _ way _
no _
we _ have _ n't _ had _ any _ since E uh E oh E just _ before _ christmas _
and _ uh _ we _ had _ a _ lot _ before _ christmas _
um _
the _ ski _ resorts _ were _ really _
and _ uh _
but _ now _ we E have E we _ 've _ had _ fog _ for _ about _ forty _ days _ in _ a _ row _ and _ temperature _ inversion _
so _
but _ no E uh E no _ snow _
um _
the _ snows _ all _ melted _ off _ uh _
well E i _ talked _ to _ a _ woman _ who _ lived _ up _ in _ the _ hills E uh E mountains _ in _ uh E utah _ i _ guess _ this _ last _ weekend _
and _ she _ had _ uh _ quite _ a _ bit _ of _ snow _ on _ the _ ground _ her _ way _
uh-huh _
i _ guess _ there _ 's _ different _ parts _ of _ the _ state _ of _ utah _ that E that _ does _ have _ some _
but _ not _
usually _ we _ have _ up _ to _ a _ hundred _ and _ fifty _ inches _ up _ at _ the _ ski _ resorts _
and _ they _ 're _ down _ between _ thirty-eight _ and _ uh _ forty _ inches _
um _
at _ this _ time _ of _ the _ year _
and _ we _ 've _ been _ in _ a _ drought _ for _ the _ last _ five _ years _
and _ this _ is _ the _ sixth _ year _
and _ it _ 's _ getting _ quite _ serious _ as _ far _ as _ water _ next _ summer _
yeah _
well _ the _ weather _ uh _ here _ is _ always _ a _ topic _ of _ conversation _ in _ texas _
right _
but _ uh _ we _ have _ wide _ variations _ and _ have _ warm _ weather _ when _ most _ people _ have _ cold _ weather _
but _ we _ have _ our _ share _ of _ cold _ weather _ as _ well _
the _ uh _ temperature _ this _ morning _ was _ right _ at _ freezing _
it _ did _ n't _ stay _ there _
but _ it _ was _ right _ at _
oh E that E 's E that _ 's _ different _ is _ n't _ it _
um _
we _ usually _ have _ some _ of _ our _ coldest _ weather _ toward _ the _ uh _ end _ of _ january _
but _ this _ year _ it _ was _ n't _ bad _ at _ all _
i _ guess _ that _ 's _ because _ we _ had _ so _ much _ rain _
i _ know _ my _ son _ was _ telling _ me _ about _ the _ rain _ down _ there _
he _ said _ it _ was _ just _
and _ we _ read _ in _ the _ newspaper _ southern _ part _ of _ texas _ i _ flooded _ out _
oh _ yeah _
and _ uh _
well E my E uh E my _ sister _ lives _ in _ houston _
and _ they E uh E the _ river _ there _ was _ uh E in _ the _ flooding _ stage _ near _ where _ her _ son _ lives _
and _ that _ uh _ caused _ some _ uh _ concern _ of _ course _
oh _ boy _
they _ have _ a _ uh _ lake _ cabin _
and _ uh _ their _ dock _ was _ completely _ under _ water _ on _ the _ lake _
oh _ my _ gosh _
so _ we _ really _ had _ a _ lot _ of _ rain _
yeah _ my _ son _ in _ plano _ he _ lives _ fairly _ close _ to _
there _ 's _ quite _ a _ wash _ that _ goes _ down _ uh _ through _ plano _
right _
and _ uh _ there _ 's _ walking _ trails _ on _ both _ sides _ a _ walking _ path _
and _ uh _ when _ i _ 've _ gone _ down _ to _ visit _ him _ i _ 've _ gone _ on _ that _
but _ uh E that _ was _ clear _ full _ and _ up E to E up _ to _ some _ of _ the _ streets _ i _ guess _
it _ just _
yeah _
we _ had _ a _ lot _ of _ flash _ floods _ in _ the _ area _
we _ had _ a _ few _ people _ who _ ran _ into _ uh _ water _ and _ a _ few _ fatalities _ uh _ just _ a _ few _
uh-huh _
not _ more _ than _ ten _
but _
that _ 's _ funny _ that _ uh _ we _ ca _ n't _ have _ it _ in _ moderation _ instead _ of _ having _ either _ a _ drought _ or _ having _ too _ much _
well E the E uh E there _ 's _ an _ old _ profane _ expression _ about _ texas _ weather _
it _ 's _ always _ too _ damn _ cold _ too _ damn _ hot _ too _ damn _ windy _
yeah _
well _ it _ 's _ uh _ interesting _
uh _
i _ 'm _ going _ down _ to _ el _ paso _ next _ week _
and _ uh _ i _ was _ wondering _ what _ the _ weather _ was _
but _ i _ imagine _ if _ it _ 's _ that _ cold _ in _ dallas _ it _
well _ el _ paso _ wo _ n't _ be _ cold _
it _ 's E not E a E does _ n't _ get _ that _ cold _ i _ guess _ huh E
no _
it E 's E it _ 's _ quite _ southern _
and _ it E 's E it _ 's _ rare _ to _ get _ real _ cold _ in E in _ el _ paso _
uh-huh _
the E uh E you _ 'll _ be _ flying _ in _ there _
yes _
well _ uh _ take _ off _ is _ uh _ fun _ from _ el _ paso _ because _ you _ normally _
the _ way _ the _ winds _ are _ you _ take _ off _ right _ toward _ the E mountain E the _ rockies _
yes _
and _ they _ 're _ towering _ above _ you _
and _ so _ you _ circle _ back _ over _ the _ air _ and _ then _ make _ a _ circle _ around _ and _ come _ back _ over _ again _
yeah _
we _ 're _ kind _ of _ used _ to _ that _ here _ in _ utah _
course _ there _ are _ mountains _
and _ i _ fly _ into _ montana _ a _ lot _
and _ we _ have _ a _
the _ mountains _ are E are _ really _ uh E high _
and _ a _ lot _ of _ places _ we _ go _ in _ to _ you _ just _ kind _ of _ uh _
it _ 's _ in _ the _ little _ valley _
but _ i _ uh _ sure _ hope _ we _
we _ really _ need _ the _ moisture _
i _ hope _ we _ can _ get E uh E get _ some _
there _ 's _ supposed _ to _ be _ a _ storm _
but _ it _ split E went _ down _ through _ uh E northern _ arizona _ and _ southern _ utah _
and _ they _ 're _ not _ predicting _ any _ for _ the _ next _ uh _ week _ anyway _ up _ here _
so _
well _ i _ noticed _ on _ the _ weather _ map _ on _ uh _ cable _ network _ that _ there _ was _ supposed _ to _ be _ a _ storm _ front _ moving _ into _ california _ and _ on _ down _ your _ way _
but _ i _ guess _ it _ did _ n't _ pan _ out _ huh _
yeah _
well E that E 's E that _ 's _ what _ the _
above _ uh _
some _ of _ it _ went _ to _ the _ south _ and _ some _ to _ the _ north _ up _ into _ montana _
so _ that _ just _ left _ us _
we _ got _ a _ high _ pressure _ system _ which _ been _ sitting _ in _ the _
huh _
and _ uh _ we _ broke _ the _ record _ for _ the _ amount _ of _ fog _ that _ we _ 've _ had _ uh _ you _ know _
oh _ boy _
airport _ 's _ been _ shut _ down _ uh _ till _ about _ noon _ every _ day _
and _ then _ they _ seed _ the _ clouds _ or _ seed _ the _ fog _ to _ try _ to E to _ get _ the _ airplanes _ in _ and _ out _
uh-huh _
huh _
well _ we _ uh _ had _ a _ bad _ siege _ last _ uh _ christmas _ a _ year _ ago _
we _ went _ up _ to _ visit _ my _ wife _ 's _ uh E sister _ who _ lives _ in _ uh E calgary _ alberta _ can E
okay _
all _ right _
that _ 's _ a _ real _ different _ topic _
i _ 'm _ not _ sure _ i _ 'm _ familiar _ with E with _ what _ they _ mean _ of _ invasion _ of _ privacy _
i _ know _
i E guess E that E i _ guess _ you _ consider _ just _ things _ that _ every _ day _ that E would E you _ would _ think _ of _ about _
see _ i _ 'm _ a _ college _ student _
so _ i _ can _ think _ of _ lots _ of _ things _ that _ my _ roommate _ does _ that _ bother _ me _ you _ know _ that _ i _ think _ 's _ like _ is _ an _ invasion _ of _ my _ privacy _ stuff _ like _ that _
yeah _
but _ i _ think _ it E 'd E be E it _ is _ kind _ of _ a _ tough _ topic _
yeah _
i _ think _ personally _ you _ know _
i E 'm E i _ used _ to _ be _ a _ college _ student _ ten _ years _ ago _
uh-huh _
uh-huh _
but _ uh _ now _ i _ think _ an _ invasion _ of _ my _ privacy _ is _ when _ someone _ calls _ me _ on _ the _ telephone _ and _ says _ mrs _ miller _ have _ we _ got _ a _ deal _ for _ you _
uh-huh _
oh _ golly _
you _ 're _ like _ no _ you _ do _ n't _ no _
it _ 's _ like _ how _ do _ you _ know _ my _ name _
where _ did _ you _ get _ my _ phone _ number _
and _ why _ do _ you _ think _ it _ 's _ a _ deal _ for _ me _
uh-huh _
i _ mean _ those _ people _ they _ 'll _ call _ you _ any _ time _ of _ the _ day _ or _ night _ with E try _ to _ solicit _
yeah _
and _ that _ 's _ an _ invasion _ of _ my _ privacy _ i _ think _
they _ call _ late _
now E i _ mean _ now E there E 's E i _ heard _ that _ they _ were _ going _ to _ start _ calling _ on _ saturdays _ or _
oh _ they _ do _ already _
see _ that _ 's _
i _ would _ be _ so _ mad _
well _
and _ i _ 've _ even _ had _ the _ computer _ generated _ calls _ on _ sundays _ too _
really _
uh-huh _
huh _
but _ i _ do _ know _ of _ a _ way _ to _ get _ around _ the _ computer _ generated _ calls _
how _
do _ n't _ answer _ your _ phone _ hello _
the _ computer _ 's _ geared _ to E to _ start _ talking _ to _ you _ on E the E on _ the _ word _ hello E
really _
uh-huh _
huh _
i _ do _ n't _ know _
i _ think _ like E things _ that E that _
i _ think _ 's _ like _ privacy _ is _ like _ just _ like _ not _ going _ through _ my _ stuff _ like _ going _ through _ just _ like _ my _ clothes _ or _ my _ drawer _ just _ going _ through _ my _ stuff _ basically _
oh _ yeah _
that _ drives _ me _ up _ a _ wall _
are _ you _ and _ your _ roommate _ a _ similar _ size _
no _
see _ we _ 're _ not _
and _ uh _
and _ she _ still _ goes _ through _ your _ clothes _
yeah _
she _ 'll _ take _ all _ my _ shirts _ and _ stuff _
because _ she _ ca _ n't _ wear _ like _ my _ pants _
uh-huh _
but _ she _ 'll _ take _ all _ my _ shirts _ and _ my _ blouses _ and _ stuff _
ooh _
man _ i _ 'm _ just _ glad _ she _ ca _ n't _ wear _ my _ pants _ or _ my _ skirts _ or _ my _ dresses _ you _ know _
oh _ yeah _
but _ still _ she _ 'll _ just _ take _ them _
and _ she _ wo _ n't _ even _ think _ about _ it _
and _ then _ i _ 'll _ like _ see _ her _ that _ day _
and _ she _ 'll _ be _ wearing _ my _ clothes _
and _ i _ 'll _ be _ like _ you _ know _ i _ do _ n't _ like _ to _ borrow _ my _ clothes _ out _ you _ know _
i _ really _ do _ n't _
so _ i _ prefer _ that _ you _ just _ not _ go _ in _ and _ get _ them _
uh-huh _
uh-huh _
because _ she _ does _ n't _ even _ ask _ me _
stuff _ like _ that _ really _
like _ that _ 's _ an _ invasion _ of _ my _ privacy _ i _ feel _ like _
oh _ yeah _
i _ agree _
stuff _ like _ that _
when _ you _ have _ your _ door _ closed _ people _ just _ walking _ in _ and _ stuff _ like _ that _
uh-huh _
i _ was _ thinking _ like _ my _ mom _
i _ know _ this _
she _ would _ think _ this E is E like E an _ invasion _ of _ her _ privacy _ is _ like _ going _ through _ her _ purse _ like E if _ you _ ever _ needed _ money _ and _ stuff _
oh _ yeah _
we _ always _ just _ give _ her _ her _ purse _ you _ know _
and _ she _ 'll _ get _ it _ out _ or _ whatever _
yeah _
uh-huh _
i _ was _ trying _ to _ think _
i _ was _ thinking _ that _ 's _ the _ only _ thing _ i _ could _ really _ think _ of _ that _ would _ really _ be _
my _ mom _ does _ n't _ even _ like _ for _ us _ to _ go _ through _ her _ cabinets _
really _
i _ mean _ we _ 're _ all _ grown _
all _ her _ kids _ are _ grown _
and _ we _ have _ our _ own _ families _
uh-huh _
and _ now _ if _ we _ go _ through _ her _ cabinets _ she _ 's _ like _ well _ what _ are _ you _ digging _ for _
yeah _
get _ out _ of _ my _ cabinets _
like _ what _ are _ you _ doing _
do _ n't _ you _ have _ your _ own _ house _ to _ dig _ through _
that _ 's _ great _
yeah _
so _ i _ guess _ privacy _ is _ really _
and _ at _ the _ work _ place _ i _ suppose _
oh _ well _ actually _ yes _
i _ can _ say _ definitely _ privacy _ at _ the _ work _ place _
uh-huh _
i _ hate _ it _ for _ people _ to _ open _ up _ my _ drawer _ to _ my _ desk _
see _
yeah _
because _ that E was E that _ was _ where _ i _ kept _ all _ my _ stuff _
and _ i _ could _ tell _ i _ mean _ even _ if _ a _ pen _ was _ turned _ the _ wrong _ way _
you _ could _ tell _
you _ know _ you _ put _ your _ stuff _ where _ it _ 's _
yeah _
that E would E drive E that _ would _ that _
it E would E drive E it _ drove _ me _ batty _ for _ a _ while _
really _
yeah _
well _ i _ worked _ a _ second _ shift _
uh-huh _
and _ everybody _ else _ in _ my _ area _ worked _ first _ shift _
uh-huh _
and _ our _ shifts _ overlapped _
uh-huh _
so _ i _ would _ come _ in _
and _ there _ would _ be _ people _ sitting _ at _ my _ desk _ working _
and _ i _ 'm _ wondering _ you _ know _ um _ what _ is _ this _
it _ 's _ my _ vitamins _
i _ wonder _ what E is E you _ know _ yeah E what _ is _
why _ are _ they _ working _ at _ my _ desk _
and _ can _ i _ have _ it _ back _
yeah _
can _ i _ have _ it _ back _ soon _ maybe _
then _ you _ start _ missing _ stuff _
and _
oh _ yeah _
no _ mommy _ is _ going _ to _ take _ the _ vitamins _
i _ 'm _ sorry _
i _ have _
that _ 's _ okay _
see E that E would E that _ would _ make _ me _ really _ mad _
because _ you _ can _ always _ tell _ when _ someone _ 's _ touched _ your _ stuff _
just _ because _
i _ mean _ i _ know _ i _ have _ everything _ like _ a _ certain _ way _
and _ you _ know _ how _ it _ looks _ and _ everything _
oh _ yeah _
well _ you _ know _ how _ you _ left _ it _ the _ day _ before _
uh-huh _ child _ talking _
that _ would _ bother _ me _ definitely _
oh _ yeah _
so _ that _ 's _ child _ talking _
yeah _
i _ agree _
it E 's E it _ 's _ pretty _ tough _ that _ way _
and _ i _ know _ even _ like _ with _ your _ school _ books _ and _ papers _
uh-huh _
do _ you _ miss _ your _ papers _ sometimes _
see _
yeah _
uh-huh _
you _ know _
that _ 's _ the _ only _ thing _ i _ can _ really _ think _ about _ being _ an _ invasion _ of _ privacy _ like _ something _ every _ day _ though _
yeah _
well _ actually _ i _ do _ know _
and _ i _ have _ used _ it _ once _
uh-huh _
and _ it E it _ really _ is _ an _ invasion _ of _ privacy _
but _ in _ the _ library _ there _ 's _ a _ book _ that _ you _ can _ find _ out _ what _ people _ 's _ phone _ numbers _ are _ by _ where _ they _ live _ their _ street _ address _
oh _ really _
yeah _
uh-huh _
and _ that _
i _ mean _ i E 've E i _ 've _ used _ it _ once _
okay _
okay _
have _ you _ done _ this _ very _ long _
uh _ well _ yeah _
for _ the _ last _ uh _ couple _ of _ months _
yeah _
that _ 's _ the _ same _ with _ us _
yeah _
well _ what _ kind _ of _ car _ would _ you _ buy _
well _ it _ 's _ kind _ of _ hard _ to _ say _
uh _ because _ i _ do _ n't _ think _ we _ 're _ going _ to _ buy _ another _ car _ for _ about _ three _ years _
we _ just _ bought _ uh _ a _ car _ uh _ last _ year _ and _ then _ bought _ one _ in _ eighty-nine _
oh _ okay _
and _ uh _
wait _ a _ minute _
we _ bought _ one _ in _ ninety _
we _ 've _ got _ three _ cars _ of _ all _ things _
uh-huh _
so _ uh _ probably _ we _ 'll _ be _ in _ at _ least _ a _ midsize _ four _ door _ sedan _
okay _
what _ kind _ do _ you _ have _ now _
uh E we _ have _ a E a _ mazda _ nine _ twenty _ nine _ and _ a _ ford _ crown _ victoria _ and _ a _ little _ two _ seater _ c _ r _ x _
oh _ okay _
uh E it _ 's _ rather _ difficult _ to E to _ project _ what _ kind _ of _ uh E
we _ 'd _ look E always _ look _ into _ uh E consumer _ reports _ to _ see _ what _ kind _ of _ uh E report _ or _ uh E repair _ records _ that _ the _ various _ cars _ have _
uh-huh _
and _ then _ of _ course _ we _ look _ into _ the _ prices _
yeah _
and _ uh E uh E we _ 're _ not _ adverse _ to _ buying _ along _ in _ the _ summer _ when E when _ the _ cars _ could _ get _ to _ be _ discounted _
because _ we E keep E we _ 've _ begun _ to _ keep _ them _ uh E a _ longer _ period _ of _ time _
uh _ i _ traded _ off _ an _ eighty-two _ oldsmobile _ for _ the _ eighty-nine _ mazda _
oh _ uh-huh _
so _ uh _
and _ did _ you _ find _ that _ you _ like _ the _ foreign _ cars _ better _ than _ the _ domestic _
uh _ yeah _
yeah _
we E we _ 've _ had _ thirty _ some _ odd _ cars _ in _ our _ married _ life _
and _ uh E we E we _ 've _ had _ a _ good _ many _ foreign _ cars _
uh-huh _
and _ uh E they E they _ uh E
i _ 've _ been _ extremely _
we _ 've _ had _ three _ mazdas _
we _ 've _ been _ extremely _ pleased _ with _ our _ mazdas _
oh _ really _
yeah _
we _ 've _ always _ bought _ american _ made _ cars _ mostly _ oldsmobiles _
yeah _
well E we E we _ 've _ had _ uh E
let _ 's _ see _
we E had E uh E we _ had _ a _ uh E
let _ me _ think _
ause _ we _ had _ a _ fifty-three _
and _ a E uh E we _ had _ uh E two _ fifty-threes _ which _ is _ a _ long _ thirty _ minute _ story _
uh _ and _ we _ had _ a _ sixty-five _
and _ then _ we _ had _ this _ eighty-two _
uh-huh _
so _ we E we _ really _ ca _ n't _ complain _ about _ oldsmobiles _ really _
yeah _
we _ 've _ been _ real _ pleased _ with _ ours _
i _ think _ we _ 've _ had _ one _ two _ three _
yeah _
and _ most _
we E have E a E cutlass E we _ still _ have _ a _ cutlass _ supreme _ which _ is _ like E a _ seventy-seven _
uh-huh _
then _ we _ have _ a _ cutlass _ sierra _
and _ we _ 've _ had _ the _ ninety-eight _
uh-huh _
so _
but _ i _ do _ n't _ know _
we E 'll E we _ 're _ going _ to _ be _ in _ the _ market _ for _ a _ car _ probably _ in _ the _ next _ year _
and _ the _ financing _ is _ always _ something _ we _ consider _ you _ know _ the _ four _ percent _ or _ when _ they _ give _ good _ financing _ through _ the E the _ motor _ company _
uh-huh _
uh-huh _
but _ i _ do _ n't _ know _ what _ we _ 're _ going _ to _ buy _
i _ always _ thought _ i _ would _ like _ to _ try _ a _ foreign _ made _ car _
but _ boy _ with _ all _ the _ auto _ workers _ being _ laid _ off _ makes _ me _ feel _ guilty _
well _
so _
uh E my _ son _ over _ in _ shreveport _ uh E sold _ porsches E audis _ mazdas _ and _ volkswagons _ for _ ten _ years _
and _ that _ was _ one _ of _ the _ deciding _ factors _ in _ getting _ the _ mazdas _
oh _
uh E so _ uh E the _ first _ foreign _ car _ that _ we _ had _ was _ a E a _ seventy-seven _ m _ g _ m _ g _ b _
oh _ the _
was _ british _ racing _ green _ with _ real _ wire _ wheels _ and _ a _ hard _ top _ and _ a _ soft _ top _
ooh _ boy _
and _ uh _ i _ drove _ it _ mostly _
i _ 'll _ bet _ it _ was _ hard _ to _ part _ with _ that _
and _
yeah _
it _ really _ was _
my _ husband _ was _ in _ the _ air _ force _
and _ we _ got _ transferred _ to _ okinawa _
oh _
so _ uh _ we _ had _ to _ sell _ it _
which _ really _ tore _ me _ up _
oh _ yeah _
because _ uh E it E it _ it _ was _ great _ fun _
and _ then _ uh _ when _ we _ got _ to _ okinawa _ well _ we _ bought _ a _ second _ hand _
we E uh E we _ decided _ that _ uh E
we _ had _ this _ uh _ sixty-five _ oldsmobile _
and E it E and _ it _ was _ just _ too _ big _
so _ we E we _ sold _ it _ to _ a _ fellow _ who _ was _ coming _ back _ to _ the _ states _
and _ we _ got _ a _ little _ fiat _ uh E and E a E and _ the _ little _ uh E forty _ horse _ power _ mazda _ four _ door _ sedan _
oh _
so _ what _ do _ you _ think _ about _ caring _ for _ older _ folks _ dale _
well _ i _ think _ uh _ the _ elderly _ is _ a _ really _ neat _ population _ to _ care _ for _
uh-huh _
they _ 've _ got _ a _ lot _ of _ special _ needs _
and _ at _ the _ same _ time _ uh _ the _ majority _ of _ them _ do _ n't _ want _ to _ give _ up _ the _ independence _ that _ they _ have _
right _
very _ definitely _
and _ so _ you _ 've _ got _ a _ real _ balance _ to _ make _ there _
uh-huh _
what _ about _ you _
well _ i _ 'm _ thinking _ about _ it _ more _ in _ terms _ of _ my _ parents _ that _ are _ starting _ to _ get _ old _
they _ are _ n't _ really _ that _ old _
but _ they _ are _ sort _ of _ wearing _ out _
my _ mamma _ is _ a _ dialysis _ patient _
uh-huh _
and _ she _ is _ only _ about _ sixty-four _
but _ she _ 's _ had _ some _ pretty _ close _ calls _
and _ my _ daddy _ has _ to _ drive _ her _ to _ dialysis _ now _
and _ so _ she _ 's _ phasing _ out _ ounds _ like _
and E but _ she _ 's _ also _ a _ very _ very _ very _ independent _ person _ and _ does _ n't _ like _ having E having _ people _ uh E not _ being _ able _ to _ do _ things _ for _ herself _ when _ she _ wants _ to _
uh-huh _
uh _ i _ know _ they _ certainly _ do _ n't _ want _ to _ be _ in _ a _ nursing _ home _
but _ my _ daddy _ keeps _ talking _ about _ it _
i _ do _ n't _
i _ could E n't E possibly _ could _ n't _ never _ see _ him _ in _ a _ nursing _ home _
ery _ faint _
and _ my _ grand _ daddy _ also _ does E n't E like E would _ n't _ want _ to _ be _ in _ a _ nursing _ home _
he _ 's _ ninety E i _ think _ right _ on _ ninety _ right _ now _
oh _ really _
and _ he _ 's _ living _ by _ himself _
my _ grand _ mamma _ died _ a _ couple _ of _ years _ ago _
oh _ okay _
so _ but _ he _ 's _ you _ know _
as _ long _ as _ you _ can _ have _ the _ families _ take _ care _ of _ the _ people _ i _ 'd _ like _ to _ see _ them _ stay _ at _ home _
yeah _
but _ it _ gets _ hard _
my E my _ grandmother _ is _ in _ her _ mid _ eighties _
uh-huh _
and _ she _ 's _ uh _ suffering _ from _ uh _ well _ uh _ progressive _ alzheimer _ 's _ disease _
uh-huh _
so _ she _ does _ n't _ remember _ anybody _
right _
and _ uh _ she _ remembers _ things _
but _ they _ are _ things _ back _ whenever _ she _ was _ real _ young _
right _
and _ so _ with _
she _ was _ living _ by _ herself _
but _ my _ uh _ uncle _ has _ moved _ in _ with _ her _ to _ take _ care _ of _ her _
uh-huh _
and _ it _ 's _ creating _ a _ lot _ of _ problems _
right _
especially _ for _ your _ uncle _ i _ bet _
oh _ yes _
yes _
now E a _ friend _ of _ mine _ who _ was _ studying _ social _ work _ here _ in _ philadelphia _ worked _ for _ an _ adult _ day _ care _ program _ for E mostly _ for _ patient _ 's _ with _ alzheimer _
do _ they _ have _ anything _ like _ that _ in _ dallas _
in _ dallas _
uh _ yeah _
i E 've E i _ 've _ heard _ of _ several _ things _
and _ they _ are _ really _ neat _ programs _ to _ be _ able _ to _ do _ if _ you _ can _ link _ up _ with _ them _
but _ sometimes _ it _ 's _ hard _ to _ either _ find _ the _ connections _ to _ get _ them _ in _ or _ uh _ to _ be _ able _ to _ get _ them _ there _ for _ the _ day _ program _ and _ pick _ them _ up _
right _
so _ they _ are _ pretty _ limited _
right _
oh _ another _ interesting _ thing _
another _ good _ friend _ of _ mine _ who _ got _ her _ degree _ in _ social _ gerontology _ well E had _ a _ job _ for _ a _ while _ where _ she _ went _ around _ to E to _ folks _ and _ had _ them _ sort _ of _ kicked _ them _ in _ the _ pants _ to _ make _ them _ take _ good _ care _ of _ their _ older _ relatives _ to _ make _ sure _ that _ they _ would _ take _ care _ of _ their _ responsibilities _
oh _ really _
uh-huh _
i _ do _ n't _ think _ that _ was _ mainly _ with _ alzheimer _ 's _ patients _ but _ just _ patients E people _ in _ general _ who _ were _ not _ as _ independent _ as _ they _ use _ to _ be _
uh-huh _
uh-huh _
well E it E it _ 's _ it _ 's _ a _ really _ day _ care _ programs _ are _ really _ neat _ you _ know _
and _ if E the E if _ the _ people _ are _ able _ and E and _ can _ get _ up _ and _ move _ and _ everything _ like _ that _ that _ is _ one _ of _ the _ best _ things _ to _ do _
but _ i _ think _ the _ hardest _ thing _ to _ do _ is _ whenever _ you _ 've _ got _ a _ person _ who _ 's _ mentally _ very _ alert _ and _ active _ and _ their _ body _ just _ has _ n't _ kept _ up _ with _ them _
uh-huh _ ery _ faint _
right _
and _ i _ think _ that E 's E in _ a _ way _ it _ 's _ more _ some E an _ area _ where _ some _ of _ the _ day _ care _ uh E programs _ have _ left _ off _
uh-huh _
because _ you _ really _ kind _ of _ have _ to _ be _ a _ little _ bit _ mobile _ to _ be _ able _ to _ do _ those _
right _
to _ uh _ get _ there _ and _ to _ participate _ in _ the _ activities _
right _
cause _ i _ know _ there _ 's _ one _ not _ too _ far _ from E from _ me _ here _ in _ dallas _
uh _ and _ they _ have _ ceramics _ and _ pottery _ and _ needle _ work _ and _ sports _
right _
right _
but _ if _ your _ vision _ is _ gone _ and _ you _ have _ arthritis _ real _ badly _
that _ 's _ true _
you _ ca _ n't _ play _ those _ things _
yeah _
you _ ca _ n't _ do _ it _
but _ you _ can _ sing _ songs _ and E uh E and _ tell _ stories _ about _ the _ old _ times _
well _ that _ 's _ true _
i _ guess _ you _ know _ you _ were _ talking _ about _ your _
was _ it _ your _ grand _ mother _ that _ was _ having _ alzheimer _ uh _ being _ able _ to _ tell _ old _ stories _
uh-huh _
uh-huh _
you _ can _ perhaps _ get _ a _ group _ of _ people _ that _ are _ n't _ too _ far _ along _ with _ alzheimer _ talking _ about _ the _ old _ times _ and _ enjoying _ it _ themselves _ that _ way _
and _ they _ love _ to _ recollect _
i _ mean _ they _ just _ you _ know _
and _ they _ will _ just _ go _ on _ and _ on _ with _ these _ stories _
and _ they _ have _ such _ a _ memory _
do _ they _ like _ to _ listen _ to _ other _ people _ recollect _ though _
my _ grandmother _ does _ n't _
she E she _ wants _ to E to _ tell _ you _ about _ her _ story _ over _ again _
so _
right _
which _ is _ fine _ you _ know _
so _
well _ that _ is _ good _ because _ we _
um _ so _ what _ do _ you _ think _
um _
i E lived E i _ lived _ in _ sweden _ for _ two _ years _
uh-huh _
and _ in _ sweden _ they _ have _ socialized _ medicine _
and _ so _ i _ saw _ some _ of _ the _ good _
and _ also _ i _ saw _ some _ of _ the _ bad _ that _ results _ from _ such _ a _ program _
uh-huh _
uh E some E of E the E some _ of _ the _ good _ obviously _ that _ nobody _ has _ to _ worry _ about _ health _ care _
right _
so _ it E 's E a E very E it _ 's _ a _ very _ uh E comfortable _
i _ mean _ our _ people _ are _ very _ comfortable _ in _ the _ sense _ that _ you _ know _ there _ 's _ no _ medical _ emergency _ that _ 's _ going _ to _ make _ you _ destitute _ for _ life _
right _
um _ the _ bad _ was _ more _ apparent _ i _ think _ at _ least _ for _ me _
because _ i _ think _ it _ affected _ people _ 's _ lives _ on E in _ a _ way _ that _ you _ could _ see _
one E one _ thing _ that _ i _ noticed _ is _ it _ 's _ very _ very _ convenient _ to _ be _ alcoholic _ in _ sweden _
oh _ really _
because _ it _ 's _ treated _ as _ a _ disease _
now _ i _ do _ n't _ know _ if _ that _ necessarily _ has _ to _ be _ part _ of _ socialized _ medicine _
but _ uh E if E you E 're E if _ you _ 're _ alcoholic _ then _ you _ 're _ treated _ as _ if _ you _ 're _ on _ disability E long-term _ disability _
and _ so _ there _ was _ very _ little _ incentive _ for _ people _ to _ get _ out _ of _ that _
huh _
also _ um E another _ thing _ that E that _ i _ noticed _ that _ was _ very _ strange _
i E was E uh E i _ would _ go _ down _ all _ these _ uh E uh E
i _ remember _ this _ one _ row _ of _ houses _
and _ they _ were _ uh _ row _ houses _ or _ townhouses _ all _ connected _ together _ so _ it _ was _ like _ lower _ middle-class _ housing _
uh-huh _
well _ it _ would _ be _ lower _ middle-class _ housing _ here _
it _ 's _ probably _ middle-class _ housing _ there _
uh-huh _
um _ and _ there _ was _ a _ taxi _ driver _ that _ lived _ in _ one _ of _ these _
and _ there _ was _ a _ doctor _ that _ lived _ in _ one _ of _ these _
the _ one _ guy _ was _ a _ doctor _
and _ one _ was _ a _ taxi _ driver _
and _ so _ their E their _ incomes _ were _ about _ the _ same _
huh _
whereas _ here _ there _ is _ a _ great _ incentive _ to _ be _ a _ doctor _ because _ there _ 's _ a _ great _ financial _ reward _
right _
and _ that E that _ did _ n't _ exist _ in _ sweden _
right _
and _ uh E overall _ i E their _ their _ health _ care _ suffered _ fair _ amount _ from _ just _ the _ fact _ that _ the _ doctor _ salaries _ were _ lower _
and _ it E was E it _ was _ less _ professional _
and _ it _ was _ treated _ more _ like _ a E like E a _ taxi _ driver _ type _ job _ then E a E then _ a _ doctor _ type _ job _
yeah _
that E is E uh E that _ is _ something _ i _ 've _ heard _
uh _ i _ had _ a _ friend _ uh _ that _ i _ worked _ with _ that _ was _ from _ sweden _
and _ that _ was _ uh _
probably _ the E the _ major _ concern _ i _ have _ is _ that _ you _ know _ we _ are _ leading _ in _ the _ technology _ realm _ of E of _ medicine _ just _ because _ it _ is _ such _ a _ great _ incentive _ to E to _ get _ into _ uh E the _ medical _ field _
but _ at _ the _ same _ time _ it _ 's _ real _ hard _
i _ mean _ my _ husband _ works _ for _ a _ company _ that _ provides _ insurance _
and _ so _ you _ know _ i _ 'm _ real _ you _ know _
it _ 's _ like _ well _ you _ know _ you _ know _
there _ 's _ got _ to _ be _ better _ ways _ you _ know _ to _ do _ some _ things _
but _ you _ know _ i _ hate _ to _ uh _
the E the _ competition _ in _ a _ lot _ of _ ways _ is E is _ wonderful _ just _ because _ you _ can _ choose _ your _ doctor _
and E and _ uh E they _ have _ to _ compete _ to E be E to _ be _ good _ and _ to _ be _ knowledgeable _
but _ at _ the _ same _ time _ there E 's E a E you _ know _ they _ 're _ regulating _ themselves _
and E and _ the _ hospitals _ are _ charging _ just _ enormous _ amounts _ for _ products _ that _ they _ do _ n't _ have _ to _ pay _ very _ much _ for _
my E i _ have _ a _ brother _ who _ 's _ a _ vet _
and _ for _ something _ that _ he _ can _ get _ you _ know _ wholesale _
and _ i _ 'm _ sure _ they _ can _ get _ a _ lot _ cheaper _ because _ they E they _ hospitals _ buy _ in _ such _ a _ bulk _ rate _ um E
right _
you _ know _ they _ could _ charge _ you _ twenty _ dollars _ for _ a _ dollar _ fifty _ item _
and _ that _ 's _ ridiculous _
and _ i _ do _ n't _ think _ that E is E that _ is _ uh E abnormal _ in _ any _ means _ to _ be _ doing _ things _ like _ that _
and _
you _ do _ n't _ think _ it _ 's _ abnormal _
i _ do _ n't _ think _ it _ 's _ abnormal _ for _ hospitals _ to _ be _ doing _ that _ at _ all _
oh _ i _ see _
you _ 're _ not _ saying _ it _ 's _ right _
you _ 're _ just _ saying _ it _ 's _ common _
yeah _
and _ so _ it E 's E i E think E to _ me _ i _ think _ uh E something _ that _ 's _ going _ to _ help _ our _ medical _ uh E arena _ is _ for _ um E
and _ i E do E n't E know E how E to E i _ do _ n't _ know _ how _ to _ do _ this _
but _ i _ think _ people _ are _ too _ lawsuit _ happy _
and _ i _ mean _ things _ will _ happen _
and E and _ you _ 've _ got _ to _ uh E keep _ up _
or _ you _ 've _ got _ to _ realize _ that _ you _ know _ it _ is _ just _ men _ or _ women _ that E are E that _ are _ making _ um E decisions _
and _ they _ will _ make _ mistakes _
and _ you _ know _ if _ people _ you _ know _
there _ are _ some _ people _ that _ i _ 'm _ sure _ make _ mistakes _ because _ they _ just _ do _ n't _ keep _ on _ top _ of _ it _
but _ there _ are _ other _ things _ that _ just _ happen _ that _ you E ca E n't E you _ know _ you _ ca _ n't _ say _ you _ know _ well E if _ you _ had _ just _ done _ this _ you _ know _ things _ would _ have _ done _ differently _
and _ um _ i _ do _ n't _ know _
i E i _ think _ the _ fact _ that _ malpractice _ has _ gone _ up _ i _ think _ has _ raised _ our _ prices _ just _ dramatically _ um E in E the E in _ the _ last _ number _ of _ years _
yes _
and _ i _ think _ that _ 's _ something _ that _ if E if _ they _ could _ work _ on _ the _ cause _ of _ that _ and _
it _ 's _ uh _
i _ 'll _ start _ off _ here _
uh _ i _ do _ n't _ know _
i _ get _ probably _ most _ of _ my _ information _ either _ from _ the _ newspaper _ or _ from _ c _ n _ n _
uh _ i _ like _ c _ n _ n _ because _ it _ uh _ you _ know _ repeats _ it _
well _ headline _ news _ repeats _ every _ half _ hour _
but _ it _ makes _ it _ really _ convenient _ cause _ i _ keep _ a _ rather _ hectic _ schedule _
right _
yeah _
and _ uh _
but _ the _ newspaper _ provides _ a _ little _ bit _ of _ depth _ that _ you _ ca _ n't _ really _ get _ from _
yeah _
i E i _ think _ i _ 'd _ agree _
a E a _ similar _ method _ of _ getting _ the _ news _ with _ me _ too _
it E 's E uh E uh E c _ n _ n _ has _ been _ a _ welcome _ addition _ to _ the _ t _ v _ scene _ here _ in _ the _ last _ uh E number _ of _ years _
uh _ prior _ to _ cable _ you _ know _ you _ did _ n't _ get _ much _ news _ off _ of _ normal _ uh _ television _ broadcasts _
right _
uh E just _ usually _ pretty _ local _ in E in _ nature _
and E and _ i _ like _ uh E c _ n _ n _ because _ you _ get _ some _ world E world _ events _ too _ uh E which _ is _ not _ too _ common _ on E on _ the _ other _ format _ newspapers _ and _ so _ forth _
uh-huh _
right _
yeah _
i _ know _ the _
my _ only _ major _ objection _ is _ that _ uh E i _ do _ n't _ think _ american _ media _ spends _ enough _ uh E attention _ on E on _ our _ closest _ neighbors _ like _ mexico _ and _ canada _
uh _
that E that _ 's _ true _ you _ know _
you _ hardly _ ever _ see _ uh E headline _ articles _ about _ the E uh E either _ the _ economics _ or E or _ other _ news _ events _ going _ on _ in _ either _ of _ those _ countries _
uh-huh _
yeah _
uh E whereas _ if _ you _ pick _ up _ a E a _ european _ paper _ you _ know _ uh E it E all _ the _ surrounding _ countries _ soviet _ union _ and _ everything _ has _ uh E major _ news _ uh E articles _ in _ them _
right _
yeah _
i _ mean _ you _ know _ canada _ has _ gone _ through _ a _ lot _ of _ problems _ now _ with E with _ quebec _ and E and _ everything _
and _ uh _ it _ 's _ amazing _ that _
you _ know _ i E i _ listen _ to _ d _ c _ area _ and _ the _ washington _ post _ you _ know _
i _ mean _ the _ most _ they _ 'll _ give _ it _ is _ the _ back _ of _ the E a _ section _
yeah _
uh _ you _ know _
i E 'm E i _ 'm _ currently _ living _ in _ dallas _
you E just E never E see E you _ just _ never _ see _ anything _ about _ it _
uh _ which _ is _ a _ shame _ because _ you _ go _ to _ other _ countries _ uh _
and E and _ they _ carry _ quite _ a _ bit _ about _ the _ u _ s _ on _ the _ other _ hand _
and _ if _ you _ go _ up _ to _ uh E canada _ those _ people _ are _ usually _ pretty _ uh E familiar _ with _ the _ politics _ going _ on _ and E and _ the _ news _ u _ s _
uh-huh _
and _ we _ 're _ pretty _ uh E limited _ in _ our _ understanding _ of E of _ leaders _ up _ in _ canada _ or _ mexico _
yeah _
definitely _
you _ just _ do _ n't _ know _ what _ 's _ going _ on _
yeah _
i E 'd E i _
every _ once _ in _ awhile _ i _ have _ to _ travel _ overseas _
and _ lately _ i _ 've _ taken E the E taken _ a _ little _ shortwave _ radio _ uh E around _ and _ picking _ up _ the _ b _ b _ c _
and _ it _ 's _ sort _ of _ like _ uh _ a _ c _ n _ n _ too _
you E you _ can _ tune _ into _ some _ stations _
uh-huh _
and _ you _ get _ some _ like E thirty _ minute _ summaries _ of E of _ news _ events _
uh _ i _ occasionally _ get _ into _ some _ of _ the _ middle _ eastern _ uh _ area _
there _ 's _ not _ much _ in _ the _ way _ of _ television _ in _ some _ of _ those _ places _
right _
uh E but _ that _ 's _ a _ good _ point _ about E about _ the _ neighboring _ countries _
i _ had _ n't _ really _ thought _ about _ it _
but _ i _ guess _ you _ do _ n't _ think _ about _ it _ cause _ you _ do _ n't _ hear _ it _
right _
exactly _
yeah _
i _ uh _ spent _ this _ past _ summer _ up _ in _ canada _
uh _ well _ part _ of _ it _ touring _
and _ uh _ you _ know _ i _ was _ amazed _ cause _ i _ 'd _ pick _ up _ a _ local _ paper _ and _ i _ 'd _ read _ about _ all _ of _ these _ you _ know _ really _ interesting _ things _ going _ on _
there _ 's _ some _ serious _ talk _ about _ whether _ there _ 's _ actually _ going _ to _ be _ a E a _ canada _ you _ know _ in _ the _ next _ five _ years _ you _ know _ because _ of _ the _ problems _ with _ quebec _
yeah _
and _ i _ had _ never _ heard _ any _ of _ that _ before _
yeah _
you _ know _ there _ was _ a E a _
what _ is _ it _ called _
is _ it _ meech _ lake _ accord _
uh-huh _
or E or _ that _ 's _ just _ something _ uh E i _ 'd _ say _ ninety _ percent _ of _ the _ people _ here _ would _ never _ have _ heard _ of _
and _ i _ think _ that _ i _ heard _ of _ it _ about _ the _ first _ time _ when _ i _ was _ up _ in _ calgary _ a _ couple _ of _ years _ ago _ and _ you _ know _ picked _ up _ a E a _ paper _ and _ started _ reading _ a _ little _ bit _ more _ detail _ about _ it _
and E and _ came _
it _ was _ a _ big _ thing _ going _ on _ there _
and _ i _ came _ back _ here _
and _ nothing _ in _ the _ papers _
right _
right _
i _ did _ n't _ see _ a _ thing _ about _ it _
so _ it E 's E uh E we _ 've _ got _ a _ long _ ways _ to _ go _ i _ guess _
it _ 's _ improved _
and _ like _ i _ say _ with _ c _ n _ n _ and E and _ uh E the _ cable _ news _
even E even _ there _ 's _ uh E uh E
it E 's E it _ 's _ semireligious _ in _ some _ respects _
but _ what _ is _ it _
it E 's E uh E i _ mean _ it _ 's _ news _ is _ not E not _ that _ way _
uh _ oh _ i _ 'm _ trying _ to _ think _ of _ the _ channel _
the E the _ christian _ science _ monitor _
oh _ yeah _
uh E i E it _ surprised _ me _
i _ 've _ caught _ it _ a _ few _ times _
and _ they E they _ do _ some _ pretty _ good _ news _
uh _ seemingly _ unbiased _ news _ broadcasts _
uh E uh E the E the _ title _ of _ the _ network _ is _ sort _ of _ surprising _
uh-huh _
you _ 'd _ think _ it _ would _ carry _ mostly _ religious _
but _ it E it _ does _ n't _ seem _ to _
so _ i _ 'll _ flip _ through _ and _ listen _ to _ it _ once _ in _ awhile _ too _ uh E and _ catch _ something _ maybe _ a _ little _ different _ than E than _ c _ n _ n _ might _ be _ covering _
uh E some _ more _ interest _ type _ topics _ in E in _ other _ countries _
but _ it _ 's _ kind _ of _ world E world _ uh E network _ too _
yeah _
uh E i E i _ guess _ i _ 've _ never _ seen _ the _ t _ v _ show _
i _ used _ to _ get _ the _ uh _
a _ uh _ golden _ retriever _
ooh _ that _ 's _ one _ of _ my _ favorite _ kinds _ of _ dogs _
yeah _
is _ it _ really _
how _ long _ have _ you _ had _ it _
we _ 've _ had _ him _ for _
let _ 's _ see _ he _ just _ had _ his _ fourth _ birthday _
fourth _ birthday _
yeah _
and _ we _ got _ him _ when _ he _ was _ about _ eight _ weeks _ old _
and _ uh _ he _ 's _ pretty _ okay _
we _ like _ him _
does _ he _ shed _ a _ lot _
he _ does _
that _ 's _ the _ one _ thing _ we _ do _ n't _ like _ about _ him _
in _ fact _ we _ threaten _ him _ in _ the _ summertime _ that _ we _ might _ just _ shave _ all _ of _ his _ hair _ off _
he _ 'd _ probably _ look _ pretty _ funny _ if _ we _ did _ that _
how _ much _ does _ he _ weigh _ now _
he E actually _ he _ just _ went _ to _ the _ vet _ yesterday _ to _ get _ his _ shots _ and _ everything _
and _ they _ put _ him _ on _ the _ scale _
and _ he _ 's _ up _ to _ ninety _ four _ now _
oh _
but _ he E 's E not E a E real E he _ 's _ not _ a _ real _ tall _ uh E dog _ for _ a _ golden _ retriever _
he _ 's _ kind _ of _ stocky _ shorter _ and _ stockier _
um _
but _
is _ he _ good _ with _ family _
he _ is _
it _ 's _ uh _ just _ me _ and _ my _ wife _
and _ uh _ he _ 's _ kind _ of _ our _ temporary _ substitute _ for _ having _ kids _
we _ treat _ him _ like _ our _ kid _ right _ now _ so _ he _ 's _ spoiled _ rotten _
yeah _
i _ can _ understand _ that _
because _ i _
get _ away _ with _ that _ a _ little _ bit _ more _ with _ pets _ than _ you _ can _ with _ kids _
uh-huh _
how _ about _ you _
well _ we _ have _ a _ cat _ who _ 's _ also _ about _ four _ years _ old _
oh _
and _ he _ 's _ our _ spoiled _ child _ right _ now _ too _
uh-huh _
and _ he _ also _ sheds _ a _ lot _
yeah _
but _ we E uh E we _ hope _ to _ get _ a _ golden _ retriever _ someday _
but _ we _ figure _ we _ 'll _ get _ the _ kids _ and _ then _ the E the _ dog _
that _ 's _ probably _ a _ good _ idea _
they _ 're _ good _ though _
uh _ have _ you _ ever _ had _ a _ retriever _ before _
no _
but _ my _ husband _ had _ one _ when _ he _ was _ growing _ up _
because _ i E i _ find _ that _ they _ 're _ good _ around _ other _ animals _ like _ cats _ and _ other _ dogs _
they _ do _ n't _ tend _ to _ get _ real _ jealous _ or _ territorial _
they _ like _ to _ play _
um _
especially _ with _ the _ kids _
they _ love _ to _ play _ with _ kids _
is E is _ your _ dog _ an _ inside _ and _ outdoors _
no _
he _ 's _ pretty _ much _ an _ inside _ dog _
um _
he _ stays _ in _
we E we _ 're _ kind _ of _ in _ a E not _ a _ real _ busy _ neighborhood _ but _ more _ so _ than _ i _ 'd _ want _ him _ to _ be _ out _ too _ much _
and _ he _ does _ n't _ like _ it _ if _ we _ tie _ him _ outside _
oh _ really _
he _ 's _ really _ a _ wimp _
and _ when _ it _ comes _ to _ being _ alone _
uh _ now _ if _ you _ give _ him _ the _ freedom _ to _ walk _ around _ and _ go _ wherever _ he _ wants _ he _ likes _ that _
but _ he _ does _ not _ like _ to _ be _ tied _ outside _
he E 'll E he _ 'll _ just _ bark _ and _ bark _ and _ bark _
um E when _ he _ gets _ outside _ does E in E does _ he _ run _ away _ and _ then _ eventually _ come _ back _
no _
he _ 's _ uh _ taken _ to _ the _ training _ pretty _ well _
and _ uh _ he _ knows _ where _ our _ yard _ is _
and _ we _ have _ a _ pretty _ small _ yard _
but _ he _ seems _ to _ know _ the _ boundaries _
um _
and _ he _ usually _ is _ good _ about _ staying _ within _ them _
although _ our _ next _ door _ neighbors _ have _ a _ dog _ too _
and _ uh E she E she _ is _ good _ friends _ with _ my _ dog _
oh _ yeah _
and _ so _ he _ often _ gets _ to _ smelling _ her _ scent _ and _ will _ go _ over _ there _ to _ sniff _ around _ and _ stuff _
but _ he _ 's _ pretty _ good _
he _ stays _ out _ of _ the _ street _
and _ uh _ if _ i _ catch _ him _ i _ call _ him _
and _ he _ comes _ back _
so _ he E he _ 's _ pretty _ good _ about _ taking _ to _ commands _ and E and _ things _
um _
did _ you _ bring _ him _ to _ a _ doggy _ obedience _ school _ or _ just _ train _ him _ on _ your _ own _
no _
we _ never _ did _
and _
i E i _ trained _ him _ on _ my _ own _
and _ uh _ this _ is _ the _ first _ dog _ i _ 've _ had _ all _ my _ own _ as _ an _ adult _
uh-huh _
we _ 've _ had _ kid _ or _ we _ 've _ had _ dogs _ when _ i _ was _ a _ kid _
but _ this E this _ is _ the _ first _ one _ that _ i _ uh E took _ in _
so _ i _ was _ n't _ sure _ if _ i _ 'd _ be _ able _ to _ get _ it _ all _ right _ the _ first _ time _
but _ uh E he E he _ seems _ to _ have _ picked _ it _ up _ pretty _ well _
i _ never _ really _ to _ hit _ him _ or _ anything _
uh-huh _
just _ you _ know _ firm _ tone _ of _ voice _ and _ those _ sorts _ of _ things _
huh _
really _
i E i _ see _ other _ people _ out _ there _
and _ they _ hit _ their _ dogs _ and _ try _ to _
and E and _ those _ horrible _ collars _ that _ they _ put _ on _ them _ with _ invisible _ fencing _
least _ i _
invisible _ what _
invisible _ fencing _
have _ you _ heard _ of _ that _
no _
what _ is _ that _
it E 's E uh E it _ 's _ a _ system _ you _ can _ put _ in _ your _ yard _ where _ you _ bury _ these _ little _ uh E transducers _ or _ emitters _ in _ your _ yard _ at _ the _ perimeter _
oh _
and _ then _ they _ wear _ a _ collar _ with _ a _ special _ little _ attachment _ on _ it _
and _ if _ they _ get _ too _ close _ to _ that _ perimeter _ it E it _ zaps _ them _
oh _
boy _
yeah _
i _ 'd _ be _ afraid _ to _ walk _ around _ if _ i _ was _ that _ dog _
yeah _
well _ a _ friend _ of _ mine _ at _ work _ here _ said _ that _ he _ tried _ it _ with _ his _ dog _
and _ he _ wanted _ to _ see _ what _ he _ was _ subjecting _ his _ dog _ to _
so _ he _ held _ on _ to _ the _ collar _
and _ he _ walked _ out _ to _ the _ perimeter _
he _ said _ it _ was _ a _ good _ jolt _
oh _ really _
yeah _
and _ so _ i E i _ do _ n't _ take _ too _ well _ to E to _ those _ sorts _ of _ training _ techniques _
um _
i _ do _ n't _ think _ they _ 're _ always _ necessary _
if _ you _ put _ enough _ patience _ into _
yeah _
just _ be _ consistent _ and _ diligent _ with _ it _
uh-huh _
and _ um _
it E 's E uh E is _ your _ cat _ an _ indoor _ cat _ or _ an _ outdoor _ cat _
yeah _
he _ 's _ indoor _ and _ all _ declawed _ because _ i _ know _ the _ uh _ average _ life _ span _ of _ an _ outdoor _ cat _ is _ eighteen _ months _
somebody _ just _ told _ me _ that _
yeah _
because _ of _ the _ leukemia _
yeah _
that _ and _ also _ just _ uh _ getting _ hit _ i _ guess _ or _ getting _ beat _ up _
and _ the _ average _ life _ span _ of _ an _ indoor _ cat _ is _ eighteen _ years _
wow _
so _
quite _ a _ difference _
yeah _
what E uh E what _ kind _ of _ climate _ do _ you _ have _
well E uh E it E 's E we _ just _ moved _ recently _
so _ now _ we _ 're _ in _ the _ uh _ dallas _ area _
and _ it _ 's _ very _ very _ nice _
oh _
and _
the _ only _ experience _ i _ have _
i _ do _ n't _ have _ any _ children _
but _ i E 've E uh E i _ was _ a _ baby-sitter _ in _ high _ school _
and _ then _ just _ recently _ after _ we _ were _ married _ i _ baby-sat _ for _ a _ dentist _ while _ she _ worked _
and _ i _ just _ uh _
that _ 's _ the _ only _ thing _ i _ 've _ ever _ done _ also _ is _ baby-sit _
is _ it _ ery _ faint _
but _ uh _ i _ 've _ heard _ people _ that _ i _ work _ with _ talk _ about _ you _ know _ child _ care _
especially _ i _ guess _ it _ 's _ even _ harder _ on _ single _ mothers _
oh _ yeah _
the _ expense _
yeah _
having _ to _ pick _ up _ the _ kid _ by _ you _ know _ six _ o'clock _
or _ it _ 's _ five _ dollars _ for _ every _ minute _ you _ 're _ late _ and _ stuff _ like _ that _
uh-huh _
which _ is _ understandable _
i _ mean _ these _ people _ ca _ n't _ you _ know _ stay _ there _ till _ eight _ o'clock _ because _ somebody _ has _ to _ work _ late _
just _ sit _ around _
that E that _ 's _ true _
but _
see _ the _ lady _ i _ did _ it _ for _
that _ 's _ why _ she _ picked _ me _ is _ because _ i _ would _ go _ to _ her _ house _ so _ she _ would _ n't _ have _ to _ get _ her _ little _ girl _ up _
so _ she _ could _ sleep _ in _
and _ uh _ then _ she _ could _ be _ at _ home _
and _ then _ i _ 'd _ bring _ her _ to _ my _ house _ for _ a _ couple _ of _ hours _ if _ i _ wanted _ too _ or _ whatever _
but _ uh E she _ paid _ i E think E it E was E two E or _ i _ think _ it _ was _ about _ two _ fifty _ three _ dollars _ a _ hour _
and _ by _ the _ time _ i _ paid _ taxes _ on _ it _ it E i _ was _ getting _ like E eighty _ cents _
and _ that _ was _ n't _ counting _ food _ or _ gas _ or _ anything _
oh _ no _
yeah _
it _ 's _ hardly _ worth _ your _ time _
yeah _
yeah _
that _ 's _ pretty _ bad _
the _ only _ time _ i _ baby-sat _ was _ in _ high _ school _
and _ it _ you _ know _
of _ course _ you _ do _ n't _
i _ did _ n't _ pay _ taxes _ on _ that _
so _
right _
it _ was _ easy _ you _ know _ go _ over _ to _ some _ uh _
it _ was _ these _ people _ that _ lived _ in _ our _ neighborhood _
and _ i _ 'd _ just _ go _ over _ there _
every _ thursday _ night _ they _ went _ to _ the _ theater _
they _ had _ permanent _ tickets _
and _ they _ 'd _ give _ me _
it _ was _ supposed _ to _ be _ two _ dollars _ an _ hour _ for _ two _ kids _
but _ they _ would _ usually _ give _ me _ like _ five _ dollars _ more _ at _ the _ end _ of _ the _ night _
oh _ wow _
and _ i _ mean _ they _ 'd _ you _ know _
it _ was _ great _
i _ 'd _ go _ over _ there _
and _ there _ would _ be _ like E uh E you _ know _ there E 's E we _ have _ these _ videos _ over _ here _
watch _ whatever _ you _ want _
and _ there _ 's _ some _ oreos _ in E the E in _ the _ cupboard _
and _ there _ 's _ some _ coke _
and _ you _ know _ just _ help _ yourself _ to _ anything _
so _ it E was E it _ was _ you _ know _ the _ best _
wow _
that _ was _ a _ long _ time _ ago _
and _ that _ was _ only _ for _ a _ few _ years _
just _ once _ a _ week _
yeah _
but _ i _ do _ n't _ know _
i _ think _ people _ that _ treat _ their _ baby-sitters _ like _ that _ get _ a _ lot _ better _ baby-sitters _
oh _ yeah _
that _ 's _ true _
and _ they _ stick _ around _ for _ longer _
because _ i _ mean _ after _ i _ figured _ out _ i _ was _ getting _ eighty _ cents _ an _ hour _ i _ said _ bag _ it _
and _ i _ quit _ you _ know _
yeah _
i _ was _ just _ like _ but _ i _ 'm _ wasting _ my _ time _
yeah _
i _ really _ liked _ the _ little _ girl _ and _ everything _
but _ i _ thought _
she _ does _ take _ up _
and _ they _ do _ take _ up _ a _ lot _ of _ your _ time _
that _
yeah _
yeah _
i _
they _ 're _ very _ demanding _
uh-huh _
well _ and _ she _ was _ really _ spoiled _
they _ did _ n't _ make _ her _ eat _ anything _ she _ did _ n't _ want _ or _ anything _
so _ basically _ they _ fed _ her _ cookies _ for _ breakfast _ and _ lunch _
and _ the _ mom _ was _ a _ dentist _
and _ i _ was _ just _ like _ we _ 've _ got _ to _ quit _ this _
and _ she _ 's _ like _ no _ i _ do _ n't _ want _ her _ to _ starve _
but _ i _ do _ n't _ want _ to _ make _ her _ eat _ something _ she _ does _ n't _ want _ to _ eat _
oh _ shoot _
my _ mom _ would _ be _ like _ uh _ eat _ it _ or _ do _ n't _ eat _ anything _
that _ 's _ right _
so _ i _ can _ see _ the _ concerns _ on _ what _ different _ people _ want _
yeah _
because _ some _
i _ mean _ you _ know _ if _ i _ was _ setting _ up _ a _ daycare _ there _ would _ be _ so _ many _ needs _ you _ would _ have _ to _ customize _ your _ service _ to _
yeah _
uh-huh _
cause _ some _ parents _ wo _ n't _ put _ up _ anything _ where _ others _ would _
i _ think _
yeah _
i _ think _ the _ best _ way _ to _ go _ would _ just _ be _ to E to _ be _ able _ to _ do _ it _ out _ of _ your _ basement _
uh-huh _
and _ just _ have _ like _ at _ the _ most _ like _ ten _ kids _
and _ all _ from _ maybe _ people _ that _ you _ know _ type _ of _ thing _
no _
instead _ of _ trying _ actually _ to _ set _ up _ a _ daycare _ where _ you _ do _ n't _ know _ the _ people _ coming _ in _ and _
that _ 's _ true _
i E i _ 'd _ love _ to _ do _ it _
but _ i _ just _ do _ n't _ trust _ people _ now _
there _ 's _ too _ many _ lawsuits _
yeah _
i E just E i _ think _ it _ 's _ a _ bigger _ risk _ than _
more _ than _ what _ it _ 's _ worth _
yeah _
yeah _
it _ would _ scare _ me _
with _
i _ do _ n't _ know _
cause _ i _ 'm _ sure _ some _ of _ them _ have _ good _ reason _ to _ sue _
but _ i _ think _ a E lot E of E them E are E just E you _ know _ they _ 're _ negligent _
and _ they _ get _ happy _ about _ money _
and _ they _ just _ want _ to _ sue _ you _
yeah _
well _ yeah _
that _ 's _
yeah _
exactly _
when _ you _ have _ like _ a _ kindercare _ or _ something _ set _ up _ and _ when _ they _ get _ greedy _ or _ whatever _ that _ 's _ when _ they _ have _ maybe _ one _ assistant _ to _ twenty _ kids _ or _ something _
uh-huh _
oh _ yeah _
and _ that _ 's _ just _ you _ know _
you _ ca _ n't _ watch _ that _ many _ little _ kids _ getting _ into _ things _ at _ one _ time _
that _ 's _ impossible _
you _ know _ you _ never _ know _ what _ they _ 're _ going _ to _ get _ into _
i _ have _ a _ girlfriend _ that _ works _ at _ a _ daycare _
and _ she _ takes _ her _ little _ girl _ with _ her _
and _ i _ mean _ she _ told _ me _ about _ half _ the _ people _ that _ they _ hire _
and _ half _ of _ them _ she _ 'd _ like _ to _ turn _ them _ into _ the _ state _
and _ that _ 's _ the _ people _ that _ are _ working _ there _ you _ know _
and _ then _ she _ would _ like _ to _ turn _ in _ half _ of _ the _ parents _ that _ drop _ their _ kids _ off _ because _ of _ the _ condition _ the _ kids _ are _ in _ you _ know _
oh _ that _ 's _ horrible _
like E they E 'll E be E in E the E same E clothes E they _ were _ the _ day _ before _ the _ same _ diaper _
huh _
you _ know _ just _ awful _ things _
and _ so _ i _ do _ n't _ know _
i _ do _ n't _ have _ kids _
but _ i _ always _ think _ man _ i _ just _ do _ n't _ know _ if _ i _ could _ trust _ anybody _
i _ mean _ you _ just _ do _ n't _ know _
yeah _
that _ 's _
yeah _
that _ 's _ a _ hard _ thing _ about _ it _
if E i _ mean _ i E i _ ca _ n't _ foresee _ myself _ getting _ married _
but _ if E you _ know _ if _ i _ ever _ wanted _ to _ have _ a _ kid _ how _ could _ i _ work _
i _ mean _ i _ do _ n't _ think _ i _ could _ trust _ somebody _ with _ my _ kid _ either _
unless _ it _ was _ a _ friend _ that _ you _ know _ did _ it _ in _ ounds _ like _ an _ airplane _ their _ house _ that _ i _ knew _ well _
oh _ yeah _
that _ 's _ true _
yeah _
i E just E i _ could _ n't _ do _ it _ i _ do _ n't _ think _
it _ would _ just _ rip _ me _ apart _ i _ think _
i _ do _ n't _ know _
yeah _
just _ not _ knowing _
yeah _
just _ besides _ the _ fact _ that _ you _ know _ your E when _ your _ child _ gets _ out _ of _ school _ at _ three _ o'clock _ and _ then _ has _ to _ wait _
what _ do _ you _ usually _ wear _ to _
well _ let _ 's _ see _
it _ turns _ out _ that _ uh _
i _ work _ at _ tektronix _
and _ it _ 's _ a _ very _ uh _ low _ key _ place _ as _ far _ as _ dress _ goes _
uh-huh _
you _ just _ wear _ uh _
let _ 's _ see _
when _ i _ first _ came _ here _ i _ wore _ suits _
but _ after _ a _ while _ i _ got E uh E found _ out _ that _ that _ was _ n't _ all _ that _ important _
i _ 'm _ an _ engineer _
oh _ i _ see _
and E uh E so _ i _ get _ to _ wear _ just _ uh E how _ shall _ i _ say _ it _ uh E walking _ shoes _ as _ opposed _ to _ dress _ shoes _ and _ well E walking _ how _ shall _ i _ say _ it _ kind _ of _ like _ avia _ uh E walking _ shoes _ uh E
uh-huh _
well _ that _ 's _ nice _ comfortable _ stuff _
yes _
open _ shirt _ open _ at _ the _ neck _ you _ know _ no _ tie _
wow _
and _ uh E just _ uh E reasonable _ looking _ how _ shall _ i _ say _ it _ uh E sports _ clothes _ or _ some E guys E wear E some _ people _ even _ wear _ levis _
wow _
that _ 's _ nice _
now _ being _ from _ philadelphia _ i _ do _ n't _ expect _ your _ dress _ code _ to _ be _ quite _ that _ relaxed _ right _
well _ actually _ right _ now _ i _ 'm _ a _ full _ time _ college _ student _
oh _ okay _
yeah _
i _ usually _ wear _ jeans _ and _ stuff _ to _ classes _ or _ shorts _ in _ the _ summertime _
but _ over _ the _ summers _ i _ 've _ had _ a _ job _ internships _ with _ the _ newspaper _
uh-huh _
and _ that _ 's _ so _
generally _ then _ i _ dress _ you _ know _ nicer _
usually _ nice _ summer _ slacks _ or _ more _ sometimes _ skirts _ stuff _ like _ that _
so _ then _ it E 's E still E you _ know _ the _ emphasis _ is _ on _ comfort _ a _ lot _ because _ it _ 's _ a _ lot _ of _ walking _ and _ coming _ out _ of _ office _
but _ you _ still _ have _ to _ have _ a _ professional _ imagine _ kind _ of _ thing _ to _ go _ out _ to _ meet _ people _ and _ interview _ people _ and _ stuff _ like _ that _
yes _
so _
yeah _
well E i E uh E i _ just _ recently _ applied _ for _ a _ different _ job _ in _ the _ company _ here _
and _ so _ i _ decided _ well _ i _ 'd _ wear _ a _ suit _
oh _ really _
uh-huh _
and _ it E it _ was _ very _ interesting _
uh E like _ i _ said _ most _ of _ the _ people _ at E at _ this _ company _ do _ n't _ wear _ suits _
uh E most _ of _ the _ engineers _ and _ technical _ people _ are _ just _ very _ casual _ almost _ the _ same _ clothes _ that E that _ you _ 'd _ wear _ to _ school _
wow _
that _ must _ be _ nice _ atmosphere _ then _
well _ it _ has _ been _
although _ the _ new _ president _ and _ c _ e _ o _ of _ the _ company _ is _ from _ a _ much _ more _ formal _ eastern _ uh _ background _
oh _
and _ so _ the _ result _ is _ that _ uh _
so _ anyway _ i _ wore _ this _ suit _
and _ i _ went _ over _ to E uh E uh E to _ one _ of _ the _ buildings _ that _ has _ a _ lot _ more _ of _ the _ financial _ people _ in _ it _
uh-huh _
and E it E and _ i E i _ was _ almost _ converted _ because _ uh E the _ effect _ of _ that _ suit _ on _ the _ way _ people _ reacted _ and _ responded _ to _ me _ as _ opposed _ to _ the _
uh _ just _ to _ kind _ of _
how _ shall _ i _ say _ it _
they _ know _ you _ 're _ there _
but _ they _ do _ n't _
uh _ you _ do _ n't _
there _ 's _ no _ notice _ at _ all _
but _ when _ i _ wore _ a _ suit _ that _ day _ uh _ it _ was _ obvious _ that _ people _ did _ n't _ know _ whether _ i _ was _ a _ worker _ bee _ or _ a _ manager _
wow _
so _ people E uh E how _ shall _ i _ say _ it _ made E a E made _ much _ more _ effort _ to _ notice _ you _ acknowledge _ your _ presence _ say _ hello _ and _ uh E things _ like _ that _
so _
that _ 's _ interesting _
it _ 's _ like _ a _ mini _ little _ study _ there _
yeah _
that _ 's _ really _ interesting _
and _ so _ this _ dress _ for _ success _ thing _ i _ think _ is _ uh _
by _ and _ large _ i E 've E i _ 'm _ kind _ of _ uh E convinced _ that _ uh E by _ that _ just _ that _ one _ uh E uh E experience _ and _ then _ having _ talked _ to _ several _ other _ people _ that E that _ uh E unless _ you _ 're _ in _ a E an _ environment _ where _ they _ 're _ going _ to _ make _ fun _ of E of _ of _ better _ clothes _ that _ better _ clothes _ always _ pay _ off _
right _
huh _
that _ 's _ interesting _
does _ n't _ mean _ they _ have _ to _ be _ uh _
how _ shall _ i _ say _ it _
they _ do _ n't _ have _ to _ be _ the E the _ most _ uh E the _ absolute _ best _
uh-huh _
but _ uh E a E little E dressing _ a _ little _ bit _ above _ the _ standard _ i _ think _ would _ uh E pay _ off _
so _ i _ 'm _ in _ the _ process _ of _ telling _ my _ wife _ we _ got _ to _ go _ shopping _ for _ clothes _ again _
that _ 's _ neat _
and _ uh E i E i _ do _ n't _ know _
now E i E i _ know _ eastern _
now E the _ other _ thing _ we _ do _ here _ of _ course _ is _ a E single E not _ quite _ a _ single _ climate _
we E have E uh E we _ do _ have _ some _ snow _ in _ the _ wintertime _
and _ it _ can _ be _ quite _ warm _ in _ the _ summertime _
uh-huh _
not _ hot _ like _ uh _
i _ lived _ in _ the _ midwest _ for _ a _ while _
oh _
and _ i _ know _ that _ uh _ you _ know _ it _ can _ be _ freezing _ cold _ in _ the _ wintertime _ and _ hot _ and _ uh _ sticky _ in _ the _ summertime _
uh-huh _
we _ do _ n't _ have _ that _ much _
it E 's E uh E it _ 's _ a _ very _ mild _ climate _
oh _ well _ that _ 's _ nice _
that _ 's _ good _ for _ the _ clothes _ budget _ i _ would _ imagine _
yes _
it _ is _
because _ here _ gosh _ we _ had _ uh _
the _ winter _ has _ n't _ been _ bad _ this _ winter _
it E 's E it _ it _ 's _ only _ snowed _ maybe _ once _ or _ twice _
but _ it _ 's _ been _ cold _
low _ twenties _ let _ 's _ say _
and _ then _ the _ summer _ gets _ up _ to _ eighties _ nineties _
so _
you _ interested _ in _ woodworking _
yeah _
actually _ i E uh E i _ guess _ i _ am _
um _ it _ just _ seems _ kind _ of _ funny _ that _ this _ is _ a _ topic _ of _ discussion _
uh _ i _ do _ uh _ some _ uh _ woodworking _ myself _
uh _ in _ fact _ i _ 'm _ in _ the _ middle _ of _ a _ project _ right _ now _ making _ a _ bed _ for _ my _ son _
um _ what _ kind _ of _
it E 's E uh E it _ 's _ uh E it _ 's _ uh E plywood _ uh E face _ i _ guess _
pine _
but _ i _ cut _ it _ out _ in _ the _ shape _ of _ a _ crayon _ box _
and _ then _ i _ painted _ uh _ about _ eight _ different _ uh _ colors _ uh _ you _ know _
the _ crayons _ that _ are _ sticking _ up _ it _ will _ be _ the _ headboard _
uh-huh _
i _ guess _ he _ 's _ young _
and _ then _
yes _
he _ 's _ about _ five _ and _ a _ half _ years _ old _
oh _ he _ 'll _ be _ delighted _
oh _ yeah _
uh-huh _
now _ i _ just _ have _ to _ finish _ it _ though _
i E got E uh E it _ got _ delayed _ for _ a _ little _ bit _ and E uh E because _ of _ work _
and _ now _ uh _ i _ 've _ got _ to _ jump _ back _ in _ and _ finish _ the _
because _ i _ 've _ got _ it _ all _ cut _ out _
it _ 's _ all _ uh _
i _ 've _ done _ most _ of _ the _ coloring _
but _ i _ 've _ got _ to _ go _ a _ second _ layer _ with _ the _ yellow _
did _ you _ do _ it _ with _ a _ jigsaw _
or _ do _ you _ have _ powered _ you _ know _ a _
uh _ yeah _
uh _ i _ did _ uh _ jigsaw _ uh _ and _ the _ uh _ regular _ straight _ saw _ for _ some _ of _ it _
um _
so _ yeah _
to _ do _ the E uh E the _ turn _ cut _
uh _ how _ about _ yourself _
well E i E 'm E i _ am _ interested _ in _ woodworking _
i _ do _ n't _ have _ lots _ of _ tools _
our _ local _ schools _ have _ adult _ education _ in _ the _ evening _
oh _
uh _ and _ i _ use _ their _ tools _ and _ some _ of _ their _ guidance _
i _ 'm _ an _ artist _
oh _ okay _
and _ i _ 'm _ very _ handy _
that _ 's _ great _
what E what _ type _ of _ art _ do _ you _ focus _ on _
i _ have _ a _ master _ 's _ degree _
and E and _ my _ projects _ had _ to _ do _ with _ acrylic _ painting _
but _ i _ 'm _ really _ interested _ in _ the _ crafts _
huh _
i _ make _ stain _ glass _
i _ 've _ done _ some _ silver _ jewelry _ making _
and _ i _ kind _ of _
once _ i _ get _ you _ know _ really _ pretty _ good _ at _ something _ i _ want _ to _ try _ something _ else _
yeah _
kind _ of _ jack _ of _ all _ trades _ master _ of _ none _
yeah _
well _ no _
actually _ i _ get _ good _ enough _ to _ sell _ it _ or _ have _ people _ say _ oh _ wow _
you _ did _ n't _ buy _ it _
you _ made _ it _
that _ 's _ great _
and _ then _ i E it _ 's _ like E well E the _ thrill _ is _ gone _
so _ let _ 's _ do _ something _ else _
right _
you _ want _ to _ uh _ explore _ a _ new _ field _
or E or _
well _ yeah _
i E i _ 'm _ signed _ up _ for _ a _ class _ in _ pottery _ making _ because _ i _ 've _ never _ tried _ that _ yet _
huh E so _ you _ have _ a _ m _ f _ a _ in E in _ what _ division _ of _ art _
but _
well E i E i _ actually _ have _ a _ masters _ of _ art _
and _ it _ 's _ in _ art _ education _
oh _ okay _
so _ i _ 'm _ a _ licensed _ teacher _
but _ jobs _ being _ what _ they _ are _ i _ substitute _ teach _
yeah _
and _ that _ way _ i _ have _ time _ for _ my _ kids _ too _
and _ i _ 've _ been _ fortunate _ that _ i _ can _ afford _ to _ work _ part-time _
i _ do _ n't _ know _ how _ long _ that _ 's _ going _ to _ last _
oh _ yeah _
and _ uh _ they _ 're _ cutting _ back _
so _ i _ do _ n't _ go _ in _ all _ that _ often _
but _ i _ 've _ been _ real _ interested _ in _ some _ of _ those _ cute _ country _ country _ kind _ of _ things _
uh _ i _ see _ stuff _ in _ craft _ galleries _ for _ five _ hundred _ dollars _
and _ i _ say _ oh _ no _
and E and _ i _ go _
and _ i _ make _ it _
yeah _
that _ 's _ how _ i _ started _ jewelry _ making _
i E i _ love _ to _ cook _
oh _ that _ 's _ great _
and _ i _ saw _ a _ silver _ necklace _ that _ had _ these _ little _ teeny _ weeny _ silver _ spatulas _ and E and _ and _ knife _ and E and _ a _ fork _ and _ all _ kinds _ of _ stuff _
and _ i _ went _
and _ i _ signed _ up _ for _ class _ because _ then _ again _ you _ get E you _ know _ get _ someone _ to _ guide _ you _
and _ you _ get _ the _ tools _ you _ do _ n't _ feel _ like _ buying _
exactly _
and _ i _ made _ a _ necklace _ that _ i _ saw _ in _ a _ gallery _ for _ three _ hundred _ twenty _ dollars _
it _ took _ me _ a _ lot _ of _ time _
but _ it _ did _ n't _
oh _ yeah _
but _ if _ it _ cost _ me _ twenty _ dollars _ you _ know _
and _ then _ i _
and _ your _ time _
then _ you _ 're _ that _ much _ farther _ ahead _
yeah _
then _ i _ saw _ a _ one _ of _ these _ country _ looking _ wood _ watermelons _
it _ was _ a _ solid _ watermelon _ with _ a _ wedge _ cut _ out _ of _ it _
right _
i _ 've _ seen _ them _
and _ then _ the _ watermelon _ the _ red _ with E the E with _ the _ seeds _ painted _ in _
and _
oh _ yeah _
uh-huh _
that _ 's _ neat _
i _ went _ there _
we _ have _ home _ depot _ out _ here _
i _ do _ n't _ know _ if _ you _ 've _ heard _ of _ it _
i _ went _
and _ i _ got _ two _ six _ foot _ inch _ thick _ boards _ turned _ into _ a _ watermelon _
yes _
we _ have _ one _
i _ had _ to _ cut _ into _ slabs _ and _ build _ up _ this _ big _ square _ and _ turn _ it _ on _ the _ lath _
and _ cutting _ that _ wedge _ out _ was _ no _ joke _
huh _
oh E i E 'm E i _ 'm _ sure _
we E did E it E on E a E i _ had _ a _ uh E i _ did _ it _ through _ adult _ ed _ again _
a _ band _ saw _
what _
i _ did _ it _ through _ adult _ ed _ again _
uh-huh _
and _ the _ teacher _ was _ one _ of _ these _ negative _ people _
oh _ that _ 's _ dangerous _
we _ ca _ n't _ do _ that _
we _ just _ ca _ n't _ do _ that _
and _ i _ 'm _ going _ well _ how _ about _ this _ way _
i E i _ want _ to _ do _ that _
that _ was _ the _ plan _ here _
right _
so _ we _ did _ get _ the _ wedge _ cut _ out _ by _ building _ some _ kind _ of _ a _ cradle _ for _ it _
a _ cradle _ for _ it _
yeah _
so _ you _ can _ steady _ it _
and _ then _ you _ used _ a _ handsaw _ or _ a _ backsaw _
well E it E the _ instructions _ in _ the _ book _ i _ had _ said _ use _ a _ coping _ saw _
right _
right _
and _ he _ wanted _ me _ to _ do _ it _ by _ hand _ with _ a _ regular _ saw _
i _ said _ i _ 'm _ not _ that _ steady _
it _ 's _ not _ going _ to _ happen _
yeah _
so _ we _ built _ a _ cradle _ for _ it _
and _ we E got E once _ it _ was _ turned _ we _ got _ one E one _ cut _ out _ on _ the _ table _ saw _ on _ the _ radial _ saw _
by _ getting _ the _ other _ one _ out _ without _ the _ slice _ now _ flying _ in _ your _ face _ was _ something _ you _ had _ to _ think _ about _
right _
so _
now _ did _ you _ cut _ a _ quarter _ wedge _ in _ this _
uh _ i _ 'd _ say _ it _ 's _ about _ an _ eighth _
you _ know _
well E i E i _ 'm _ envisioning _ uh E uh E a E a _ watermelon _ like _ a _ log _
and _ then _ uh E what _ i _ 've _ seen _ of _ this _ kind _ before _ is _ you _ have _ the E uh E the _ uh E
it _ 's _ uh _
if _ you _ 're _ looking _ at _ adding _ on _ you _ have _
up _ here _ in _ rochester _ uh _ we _ 're _ the _ second _ cleanest _ metropolitan _ city _ as _ far _ as _ air _ pollution _
i _ think _ grand _ rapids _ was _ number _ one _
uh _ we _ really _ do _ n't _ have _ too _ much _ of _ a _ problem _ as _ far _ as _ uh _ industry _ since _ we _ 're _ pretty _ technologically _ based _ as _ far _ as _ our _ industry _ in _ the _ city _ here _
but _ we _ do _ have _ the _ same _ problem _ a _ lot _ of _ other _ areas _ up _ here _ in _ the _ northeast _ have _
and _ that _ is _ the _ effects _ of _ acid _ rain _ coming _ basically _ from _ coal _ plants _ in _ ohio _ and _ illinois _ and _ indiana _
right _
well _ that _ 's _ true _
actually _ down _ here _ we _ do _ n't _ have _ a _ big _ problem _ with E uh E with _ air _ pollution _
mainly _ because _ we _ do _ n't _ have _ anybody _ to E to _ either _ side _ of _ us _
uh _ which _ helps _ out _ a _ lot _ as _ far _ as _ that _ goes _
i _ would _ n't _ even _ necessarily _ thought _ of _ that _ except _ when _ i _ lived _ up _ in _ boston _ and _ up _ in _ uh _ you _ know _
debates _ would _ come _ up _ up _ there _ in _ massachusetts _ and _ you _ know _ in _ that _ area _ over _ uh _ air _ pollution _
and _ their _ attitude _ 's _ basically _ well _ prevailing _ ins _ winds _ are _ to _ the _ east _
so _ why _ should _ we _ have _ to _ worry _
yeah _
i E 've E i _ 've _ uh E was _ in _ los _ angeles _ once _
and _ that _ was _ quite _ a _ difference _ as _ far _ as _ pollution _ goes _
i _ mean _ you _ could _ n't _ really _ see _ that _ much _
every _ once _ in _ a _ while _ we _ have _ these _ air _ inversions _ the _ weather _ inversions _
oh _ yes _
nothing _
and _ then _ it _ gets _ hazy _ around _ here _
but _ they _ 're _ really _
we _ do _ n't _ have _ a _ big _ problem _ with _ it _
i _ think _ that _ uh _ what _ most _ of _ the _ people _ here _ in _ new _ york _ state _ are _ going _ after _ right _ now _ is _
it E 's E it _ 's _ the _ uh E ongoing _ acid _ rain _ problem _
especially _ out _ in _ the _ uh E uh E adirondack _ areas _ where _ you _ know _ the _ lakes _ are _ becoming E uh E changing _ the _ acidity _ of _ the _ lakes _
and _ we _ 're _ having _ problems _ now _ because _ the _ fish _ are _ dying _ and _ certain _ acidic _ loving _ plants _ uh _ or _ alkaline _ liking _ plants _ are _ not _ lasting _ anymore _ because _ the _ soil _ levels _ the _ p _ h _ is _ changing _ as _ this _ acid _ rain _ continues _ to _ fall _
right _
and _ i _ know _ that _ there _ 's _ been _ battles _ over _ the _ states _ up _ here _
uh E you _ know _ governor _ mario _ going _ after _ you _ know _ governors _ of _ ohio _ and E and _ indiana _ to _ fix _ what _ 's _ going _ on _ down _ there _
i _ remember _ when _ i _ was _ in _ florida _
the _ only _ problem _ was _ that _ it _ seemed _ like _ it _ may _
oh _ absolutely _
yeah _
just _ muggy _
so _ yes _
i _ think _
yeah _
i _ think _ you _ 're _ right _
our _ most _ pollute _ substance _ down _ here _ is _ just _ water _
but _ i E i _ i _ i _ think _ you _ know _ the _ biggest _ causes _ even _ then _ a _ lot _ of _ times _ are _ uh E uh E like E when _ i _ was _ up _ in _ boston _ just _ all _ the _ cars _ you _ know _ just _ all _ over _ the _ place _
yeah _
it _
you _ just _ got _ a E lot E of E you _ know _ a _ lot _ of _ pollution _ from _ those _
and _ uh _ you _ know _ if _ you _ do _ n't _ have _ a _ wind _ it _ sticks _ around _
oh _ yeah _
i E you _ know _ i _ was _ in _ boston _ once _
and _ i _ remembered _ seeing _ some _ of _ these _ things _ coming _ through _ at _ rush _ hour _ even _ with _ the _ tee _
uh E just _ this E it _ looked _ like _ billions _ of _ cars _ massing _
absolutely _
and _ if _ they _ sit _ there _ and _ then _ there _ 's _ nowhere _ for _ the _ air _ to _ go _
i _ mean _ yeah _ that _ 's _ what _ 's _ in _ you _ know _ los _ angeles _ is _
i _ think _ that _ 's _ biggest _ problem _
because _ when _ i _ was _ in _ los _ angeles _ for _ a _ time _ it E 's E all E you _ know _ from _ los _ angeles _ to _ san _ diego _ it _ 's _ like _ all _ city _
right _
and _ there E 's E really E there _ 's _ nowhere _ for _ this _ to _ be _ absorbed _ really _
uh _ tree _ planting _ sometimes _ can _ handle _ you _ know _ stopping _ some _ of _ the _ air _ pollution _ and _ that _ and _ help _
but _ if _ you _ have _ nowhere _ to _ do _ anything _
that E 's E that _ 's _ very _ true _
uh E you _ know _ of _ course _ then _ when E when _ you _ 're _ not _ recycling _ you _ 've _ got _ these _ incendiary _ plants _ and _ stuff _ that _ can _ give _ you _ some _ pretty _ disgusting _ stuff _ going _ up _ in _ the _ atmosphere _
but _ i E you _ know _ you E 've E got E you _ 've _ got _ the _ industry _
you _ 've _ got _ that _
and _ you _ got _ the _ cars _
i _ think _ the _ cars _ are _ where E where _ it _ 's _ at _ right _ now _ as _ far _ as _ pollution _ goes _ air _ pollution _ i _ mean _
yeah _
i E you _ know _ florida _ does _ n't _ seem _ to _ be _ at _ least _ maybe _ miami _
but _ i E i _ uh E you _ know _
fort _ lauderdale _ i E i _ do _ n't _ know _ what _ the _ big _ industries _ are _ down _ there _ uh E
but _ you _ know _ up _ here _ we _ have _ kodak _
right _
and _ that _ 's _ the _ worst _ polluter _
they _ put _ uh _ uh _
you _ can _ smell _ ether _ in _ the _ air _ sometimes _
it _ keeps _ the _ neighborhoods _ happy _ i _ guess _
i _ guess _ so _
uh E cause _ they _ clean _ the E uh E the _ lenses _ for _ cameras _
and _ they E they _ make _ film _ here _
and _ they _ 're _ the _ worst _ offender _
but _ it E 's E you _ know _ it _ 's _ under _ so _ much _ control _
you _ know _ sulphur _ dioxide _ is _ the _ big _ emittant _ from _ them _
but _ that _ 's _ really _ getting _ under _ control _ now _
right _
i E you _ know _ i _ do _ n't _ know _ in _ air _ what _ they _ do _
uh E i E i _ have _ n't _ run _ across _ any _ major _ pollutants _ down _ there _ that _ i E 've E i _ 've _ really _ seen _ a _ lot _ of E you _ know _ about _
uh E i E i _ know _ i _ 've _ seen _ like E uh E
my _ grandparents _ live _ in _ corpus _ christi _ texas _
and _ i _ know _ they E 've E there _ 's _ a _ lot _ of _ refineries _ down _ there _
and _ that E that _ 's _ some _ pretty _ potent _ stuff _ they _ put _ up _ in _ the _ air _
i E but _ i _ do _ n't _ know _ how _ uh E you _ know _
there _ 's _ a _ difference _ in _ what _ you _ can _ smell _ and _ what E you E uh E you _ know _ what _ 's _ bad _
be _ interesting _ to _ see _ when E as _ mexico _ develops _ industrially _ whether _ you _ know _ without _
