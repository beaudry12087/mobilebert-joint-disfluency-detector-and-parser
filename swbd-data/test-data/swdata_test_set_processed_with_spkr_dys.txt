okay _ uh _
could _ you _ tell _ me _ what _ you _ think _ contributes _ most _ to _ uh _ air _ pollution _
well _ it _ 's _ hard _ to _ say _
i _ mean _ while _ it _ 's _ certainly _ the _ case _ that _ things _ like _ automobiles _ and _ factories _ uh _ pollute _ a _ lot _ uh _ if _ you _ look _ at _ how _ much _ pollution _ is _ say _ kicked _ up _ by _ an _ active _ volcano _ uh _ it _ 's _ certainly _ less _ than _ clear _ that _ anything _ man _ can _ do _ in _ this _ sort _ of _ scale _ of _ things _ has _ much _ effect _ at _ all _
what _ do _ you _ think _
um _ well _ you _ talked _ about _ uh _ volcanos _
i _ 'm _ not _ sure _ how _ many _ active _ volcanos _ there _ are _ now _ and E and _ what _ the _ amount _ of _ material _ that _ they _ do _ uh E put _ into _ the _ atmosphere _
i _ think _ probably _ the _ greatest _ cause _ is _ uh _ vehicles _ especially _ around _ cities _
uh-huh _
um _ uh _ do _ you _ live _ right _ in _ the _ city _ itself _
no _
i _ 'm _ more _ out _ in _ the _ suburbs _
but _ i _ certainly _ work _ near _ a _ city _
okay _
so _ can _ you _ notice _
how _ about _ you _
well E it E 's E it _ 's _
i _ live _ in _ a _ rural _ area _
uh-huh _
it _ 's _ mainly _ farms _ and _ uh _ no _ heavy _ industry _
attleboro _ itself _
i _ live _ in _ rhode _ island _
oh _ i _ see _
and _ it _ 's _ in _ the _ north _
i _ live _ up _ in _ the _ uh _ northeast _ corner _
and _ attleboro _ sits _ in E just _ over _ the _ line _ where _ t _ i _ 's _ plant _ is _
uh-huh _
but _ there _ is _ n't _ a _ lot _ of _ heavy _ industry _
there _ 's _ the _ freeways _
and _ we _ get _ an _ occasional _
it _ depends _ which _ way _ the _ wind _ 's _ blowing _ from _ boston _ cause _ we _ 're _ like _ forty _ miles _ south _ of _ boston _
so _ we _ 'll _ pick _ up _ that _
and _ uh _ i _ 've _ noticed _ over _ the _ past _ say _ maybe _ five _ or _ six _ years _ uh _
we _ live _ about _ twenty _ miles _ away _ from _ the _ state _ airport _
and _ i _ notice _ that _ the _ fly _ patterns _ now _ of _ the _ jets _ are _ getting _ bigger _
they _ 're _ swinging _ wider _ so _ that _ now _ they _ are _ coming _ over E over _ our _ homes _
uh-huh _
and _ it _ seems _ like _ uh _ we _ 're _ catching _ all _ that _ residue _
i _ 'm _ not _ sure _ if _ it _ 's _ kerosene _ or _ what _ that _ 's _ dropping _
but _ other _ than _ that _ you _ know _ we _ do _ n't _ have _ the E unless _ we _ 're _ catching _ it _ from _ the _ midwest _ the _ emissions _ you _ know _ from _ the _ power _ plants _ um E
yeah _
you _ mean _ like _ from _ the _ coal _
yeah _
yeah _
we _ generate _
one _ of _ our E our _ biggest _ electrical _ plants _ in _ rhode _ island _ uses _ coal _ to _ uh E generate _ electricity _
um _
um _ there _ does _ n't _ seem _ to _ be _ much _ emission _ from _ them _
but _ i _ 'm _ not _ sure _ about _ the _ rest _ of _ the _ country _
yeah _
i _ notice _ locally _ a _ major _ problem _ is _ kodak _
um _ it _ 's _ interesting _
because _ in _ order _ to _ uh E keep _ with _ the _ e _ p _ a _ standards _ which E which _ tend _ to _ be _ visible E uh E what _ 's _ coming _ out _ of _ your _ smokestack _ they _ do _ all _ their _ emissions _ at _ night _
uh _ so _ people _ get _ up _
okay _
well _ is _ that _ right _
yeah _
people _ get _ up _ in _ the _ morning _ in _ that _ neighborhood _
and _ they _ 've _ got _ this _ black _ ash _ on _ their _ cars _ which _ you _ know _ seems _ to _ be _
yeah _
surprise _ surprise _
yeah _
i _ mean _ i _ really _ think _ that _ if _ the _ e _ p _ a _ had _ anything _ on _ the _ ball _ they _ 'd _ go _ in _ there _ with _ a _ few _ phosphorous _ grenades _ light _ up _ the _ sky _ photograph _ the _ emissions _ at _ that _ point _ and _ uh _ you _ know _
yeah _
there E there _ must _ be _ uh E uh E some E of E the E some _ of _ the _ uh E larger _ plants _ up E uh E up _ around _ one _ hundred _ twenty-eight _
uh-huh _
um _ we _ 've _ got _ reports _ that _ uh _
during _ the _ night _ seems _ like _ they _ 'd _ blow _ off _ their E their _ stacks _ from _ uh E the _ warehouses _ for _ powerhouses _
right _
uh-huh _
and _ they _ do _ that _ at _ night _ too _ because _ employees _ been _ complaining _ that _ the _ cars _ have _ been _ pitted _ and _ you _ know _ spots _ all _ over _ them _
right _
yeah _
yeah _
so _ you _ 're _ right _
they _ could _ do _ something _ about E about _ that _ i _ guess _
yeah _
that _ seems _ a _ little _ ridiculous _
how _ are _ your E uh E your _ lakes _
and _ uh _
oh _ they _ 've _ been _ getting _ cleaner _
they _ have _
sure _
but _ um _ yeah _
i _ 'm _ not _ sure _ how _ much _ the _ water _ pollution _ is E is _ directly _ related _ to _ the _ air _ pollution _ other _ than _ acid _ rain _
yeah _
acid _ rain _
yeah _
that E 's E that _ 's _ what _ i _ was _ uh E
i _ mean _ the _ stuff _ i _ 've _ read _ recently _ in _ technology _ review _ basically _ indicates _ that _ acid _ rain _ may _ be _ a _ little _ bit _ uh _ overstated _ that _ a _ lot _ of _ the _ die _ off _ they _ 've _ seen _ in _ forests _ may _ not _ really _ be _ due _ to _ acid _ rain _ at _ all _
um _
i _ 'm _ not _ an _ expert _
yeah _
no _
did _ n't _ they _ just _ have _ an _ article _ oh _ on _ uh _
they _ were _ dumping _ lime _
up _ here _
up E upstate _ new _ york _ somewhere _ over _ huge _ areas _
i _ have _ n't _ read _ that _
oh _ yeah _
and _ they _ thought _ that _ was _ more _ beneficial _ because _ you _ know _ it E it _ some _ of _ it _ does _ soak _ in _
and _ some _ of _ it _ runs _ off _ right _ away _ into E the E in _ to _ the _ streams _ and _ rivers _
and _ some _ of _ the _ fish _ were _ supposedly _ making _ a _ comeback _
uh-huh _
i _ ca _ n't _ remember _ where _
i E i _ read _ that _ recently _ somewhere _
and _ i _ ca _ n't _ remember _ where _
yeah _
that _ 's _
but _ i E i _ thought _ it _ was _ up _ there _
so _ that _ 's _ interesting _ because _ new _ hampshire _ and _ parts _ of _ vermont _ um E they _ showed _ pictures _ of E of _ extensive _ tree _ damage _ that _ they _ attributed _ to _ acid _ rain _
uh-huh _
um _
um _ you _ kind _ of _ think _ it _ 's _ something _ else _ then _
well _ that _ 's _ what _ the _ environmentalists _ were _ claiming _ in _ this _ article _
so _ that _
oh E they E did E n't E say E they _ did _ n't _ say _ what _ though _
they _ just _ said _ they _ thought _ it _ was _
they _ did _ n't _ say _ what _
they _ just _ said _ they _ thought _ acid _ rain _ 's _ contribution _ may _ be _ less _ than _ was _ previously _ suspected _ um _ that _ it _ may _ be _ other _ natural _ things _ at _ work _ um _
uh _ natural _ disease _
yeah _
so _ it E 's E it _ 's _ less _ than _ clear _
like _ i _ said _ i _ do _ n't _ remember _ the _ article _ that _ well _
yeah _
yeah _
but _ um _ i _ do _ n't _ know _
i _ mean _ what _ do _ you _ think _ we _ can _ uh _ i _ guess _ as _ individuals _ or _ as _ a _ group _ do _ about _ uh _ air _ pollution _
uh _ we _ can _ demand _ uh _ more _ efficient _ automobiles _ for _ one _ thing _
i _ still _ think _ that E 's E that _ 's _ uh E one _ of _ our _ major _ causes _ of _ pollutants _
uh-huh _
uh E how _ we _ go _ about _ that _ it E 's E uh E uh E it _ 's _ a _ little _ bit _ difficult _
i _ think _ it _ 's _ up _ to _ individuals _ too _ to _ ask _ automakers _ for E for _ less _ pollutant _ vehicles _
yeah _
yeah _
you _ i _ think _ you _ need _ a E a _ vehicle _ something _ like _ uh E ralph E nader E nader _ 's _ raiders _ or _ where E uh E or _ uh E uh E a _ a _ r _ p _ which _ has _ a _ lot _ of _ members _ uh E if _ you _ can _ get _ those _ types _ of _ groups _
yeah _
uh-huh _
do _ you _ really _ think _ that _ new _ vehicles _ though _ is _ a _ big _ problem _
i _ mean _ i _ remember _ reading _ an _ article _ that _ said _ like _ it _ 's _ uh _ the _ older _ polluters _
the E the _ twelve _ and _ fifteen _ year _ old _ cars _ you _ know _ contribute _ like E ninety _ percent _ of _ the _ automobile _ pollution _
yeah _
and _ the _ new _ cars _ it E 's E hardly E is _ hardly _ anything _
yeah _
they _ 're _ better _
but _ how _ about _ all _ the _ trucks _ and _ buses _ that _ are _ out _ there _
uh _ when _ was _ the _ last _ time _ you _ saw _ a _ truck _ that _ did _ n't _ belch _ smoke _ or _ uh _
yeah _
but _ does _ n't _ that _ just _ mean _ they _ 're _ out _ of _ tune _
uh _ i _ 'm _ not _ really _ sure _
you _ think _ that E that _ that _ the E uh E the _ trucking _ industry _ is _ that _ uh E incompetent _ that _ they _ would _ n't _ you _ know _
fuel _ is E is _ one _ of _ their _ biggest _ costs _
right _
so _ you _ would _
but _ diesel _ engines _
yeah _
diesel _ engines _
it E you _ know _ it _ 's _ it _
i _ mean _ they _ do _ generate _ a _ lot _ of _ soot _
but _ that E at _ least _ that _ kind _ of _ particulate _ comes _ out _ of _ the _ air _ pretty _ quickly _
yeah _
yeah _
we _ could _ also _ uh _ push _ for _ legislation _ for _ uh _ rapid _ transit _ systems _
this _ country _ seems _ to _ be _ a _ little _ behind _ on _ that _
yeah _
on _ the _ other _ hand _ most _ people _ do _ n't _ use _ rapid _ transit _ because _ it _ 's _ so _ inconvenient _
um _ yeah _
but _ only _ because _ we _ got _ used _ to _ uh _ single _ person _ single _ car _ driving _
uh-huh _
a _ lot _ of _ people _ do _ n't _ even _ like _ to _ carpool _
uh-huh _
but _ we _ could _ that _
that _ 'll _ help _ pollution E air _ pollution _
uh-huh _
the _ uh E united _ states _ and _ canada _ are E i E guess E is _ is _ going _ into _ uh E some _ types _ of _ agreements _ to _ limit _ uh E what _ 's _ being _ given _ out _ by _ power _ plants _
uh-huh _
i _ guess _ canada _ 's _ quite _ concerned _ that _ we _ 're _ sending _ a _ lot _ of _ our _ stuff _ up _ there _
yeah _
sure _
so _ that _ 's _ helping _
well _ what _ do _ you _ think _ about _ like _ a _ device _ a _ meter _ right _ on _ a _ tail _ pipe _
and _ you _ pay _ the _ tax _ based _ on _ how _ much _ you _ polluted _
now _ that _ 's _ an _ idea _
do _ n't _ say _ that _ too _ loud _ though _ because _ uh E every _ city _ and _ town _ will _ have _ a _ meter _ on _ your _ tail _ pipe _ generating E generating _ revenue _
well _ it _ just _ means _ if _ you _ do _ n't _ pollute _ right _ or _ you _ pollute _ very _ little _ you _ do _ n't _ have _ to _ pay _ any _ tax _
or _ you _ just _ buy _ one _ of _ these _ things _
and _ it E it _ uh E
maybe _ you E you _ could _ probably _ devise _ them _ so _ it _ slowly _ closed _ off _ your _ tail _ pipe _
and _ uh _ the _ less _ you _ pollute _ the _ longer _ the _ devise _ lasts _
and _ if _ you _ pollute _ a _ lot _ then _ it _ closed _ off _ your _ tail _ pipe _
and _ you _ could _ n't _ start _ your _ car _ anymore _
that E 's E a E that _ 's _ an _ interesting _ concept _
is _ that _ your _ idea _
yeah _
but _ uh _ you _ know _ it _ 's _ uh _
i _ guess _ the _ difficulty _ would _ be _ to E that _ somebody _ could _ obviously _ just _ take _ it _ right _ off _ the _ tail _ pipe _ again _
so _ you _ probably _ would _ have _ to _ build _ it _ right _ into _ the _ muffler _ or _ something _
well _ i _ was _ going _ to _ say _
right _
you E could E put E it E in E you _ could _ you _ could _ it _ could _ be _ installed _ like _ a _ catalytic _ converter _
right _
i _ mean _ i _ guess _ you _ could _ take _ those _ off _ too _
but _
you _ could _ take _
but _ mufflers _ would _ be _ a _ little _ more _ obvious _ if _ you _ took _ that _ off _
yeah _
if _ you _ can _ take _ a _ muffler _ off _ and _ only _ replace _
well _ not _ unless _ it _ was _ built _ into _ every _ muffler _
right _
and _ that _ 's _
but _ if _ you _ was _ talking _ about _ something _ which _ was _ more _ or _ less _ universal _ that _ uh _ busses _ and _ any _ kind _ of _ vehicle _ had _ to _ pay _ a _ pollution _ tax _ uh _ this _ would _ penalize _ the _ heavy _ polluters _ and _ not _ penalize _ the _ light _ polluters _
that E 's E a E that _ 's _ quite _ a _ concept _
you _ should _ uh _ pursue _ that _ i _ think _ or _ patent _ it _ you _ know _
yeah _
patent _ it _
that _ 's _ a _ good _ idea _
if _ you _ could _ come _ up _ with _ a _ device _ that _ 's _ the _ thing _
right _
but _ it _ should _ n't _ be _ too _ hard _ to _ do _ something _ like _ that _
but _ that E 's E a E that _ 's _ a _ thought _
no _
uh-huh _
you _ 're _ right _
and _ that _ will _ solve _ uh _ a _ lot _ of _ problems _
i _ do _ n't _ know _ if E you E uh E if _ you _ approached _ the _ automobile _ industry _ if _ they _ would _ be _ too _ keen _ on _ installing _ something _ like _ that _
uh-huh _
uh _ but _ you _ know _ a _ proposal _ to _ uh _ uh _ i _ guess _ the _ proper _ authorities _
uh-huh _
well _ you _ might _ uh _ generate _ some _
yeah _
the _ automobile _ regulatory _ agencies _ or _ something _
yeah _
you _ might _ generate _ some _ interest _ in _ it _
but _ that E 's E that _ 's _ a _ good _ idea _
other _ than _ that _ i _ 'm _ not _ sure _ what E what _ individuals _ can _ do _ other _ than _ like _ i _ said _ get _ involved _ through _ a _ group _ or _ an _ organization _
uh-huh _
what _ are _ your _ music _ interests _
uh _ just _ about _ any _ kind _ of _ music _ except _ acid _ rock _
i E i _ do _ n't _ care _ for _ acid _ rock _
me _ too _
oh _
but _ uh _ i _ grew _ up _ with _ country _ and _ western _
yeah _
i _ did _ too _
but _ uh _
and _ then _
just _ about _ any _ kind _ of _ music _
i _ even _ like _ classical _ music _
yeah _
uh _ i _ 'm _ pretty _ diversified _ too _
i E i _ do _ n't _ i _ do _ n't _ like _ acid _ rock _ either _
i E i _ grew _ up _ in _ a _ small _ town _
so _ uh E the E only E we _ only _ had _ one _ radio _ station _
so _ it _ was _ country _ music _
yeah _
but _ then _ uh _ when _ i _
yeah _
i _ grew _ up _ with _ hank _ snow _ and _ lefty _ frizzell _ and _ hank _ williams _ and _ all _ of _ those _ old _ country _ and _ western _ songs _
oh _ really _
you _ 're _ older _ than _ i _ am _
but _ uh _ i _
did _ you _ happen _ to _ see _ last _ night _ the _ special _ on _ channel _ two _ with _ james _ galway _
we _ do _ n't _ get _ channel _ two _
my E uh E our _ cable _ does _ n't _
oh _
i _ wish _ we _ got _ that _ what _
but _
that _ is _ fabulous _
was _ it _
well _ we _ do _ n't _ get _ channel _ two _
we _
yeah _
when _ he _ played _ danny _ boy _ it _ just _ almost _ brought _ tears _ to _ your _ eyes _ because _ he _ can _ make _ that _ flute _ sing _
oh _ really _
yeah _
and _ uh _ it _ was _ tremendous _
now E he E he _ is _ a _ uh E
actually _ i _ did _
i _ played _ flute _ for _ almost _ ten _ years _
yeah _
and E and _ uh E so _ i E i _ i _ appreciate _ his _ too _ his E his _
yeah _
he E he _ he _ 's _ from _ ireland _ is _ n't _ he _
yeah _
uh-huh _
and _ it _ was _ uh _ mostly _ all _ irish _ tunes _
was _
yeah _
they _ had _ a _ band _ with _ him _ that _ uh _ had _ a _ harpist _ and _ another _ flute _ and _ then _ a _ guy _ that _ played _ the _ bagpipes _ plus _ the _ uh _ tin _ whistle _ and _ a _ couple _ of _ violins _ and _ uh _ drum _
yeah _
uh-huh _
and _ they E they _ played _ all _ the _ irish _ jigs _ and _ so _ forth _
it _ was _ just _ fabulous _
yeah _
i E he _ he _ is _ really _ good _
yeah _
i E i _ i _ come _ from _ a _ musical _ background _
yeah _
so _ uh E uh E i _ 've _ played _ flute E flute _ and _ piano _
so _ i E i _ i _ have _ a _ big _ appreciation _ for _ music _ up _ to _ a _ point _
yeah _
yeah _
i E i _ 'm _ getting _ now _ to _ the _ age _ where _ i _ do _ n't _ like _ the E new E stuff E that E 's E coming E and _ much _ of _ the _ new _ stuff _ that _ 's _ coming _ out _
yeah _
yeah _
my _ husband _ says _ i _ 'm _ getting _ old _
yeah _
i E love E uh E i _ i _ especially _ like _ instrumentals _
do _ you _
yeah _
i _ love _ to _ just _ lay _ back _ on _ the _ couch _ and E and _ turn _ a _ good E good _ instrumental _ got _ on _ and _ just _ close _ my _ eyes _ and _ listen _
yeah _
that E 's E that _ 's _ nice _ to _ do _ that _ is _
i E 've E got E a E i _ 've _ got _ a _ i _ 've _ got _ a _ two _ year _ old _ who _ 's _ now _ getting _
i _ 'm _ getting _ well _ versed _ in E in _ kiddy _ music _
yeah _
i E 'm E i _ 've _ never _ played _ an _ instrument _ in _ my _ life _
i _ 've _ always _ wanted _ too _
yeah _
i _ 've _ always _ wished _ my _ parents _ had _ forced _ me _ to _ learn _ the _ piano _ or _ something _
yeah _
but _ uh _
i _ was _ one _ of _ the _ forced _ ones _
but _ i E i _ 'd _ just _ love _ to _ be _ able _ to _ go _ to _ a _ party _ or _ something _ and _ sit _ down _ at _ the _ piano _ and _ bang _ out _ music _
oh _ i _ could _ never _ do _ that _
and _
i _ was _ never _ that _ brave _
but _ uh _ yeah _
i _ guess _ the _ closest _ i _ 've _ ever _ come _ to _ participating _ in _ music _ is _ singing _ in _ the _ choir _
yeah _
oh _ yeah _
i E 've E i _ 've _ done _ i _ 've _ done _ that _ at _ church _ too _
yeah _
i _ have _ n't _ done _ that _ in _ a _ long _ time _
yeah _
so _ let _ 's _ see _
what _
well _ what _ kind _ of _ music _ do _ you _ not _ like _
well _ like _ i _ say _ the _ acid _ rock _
i _ just _ do _ not _
an _ i _ do _ n't _ care _ for _ rap _ music _ either _
oh _
that _ 's _ not _ music _
uh-huh _
no _
that _ is _ not _
i _ do _ n't _ know _ what _ that _ is _
but _ that _ 's _ not _ music _
if _ i _ ca _ n't _ understand _ the _ words _ i _ do _ n't _ want _ to _ listen _ to _ it _
well E it E 's E it _ 's _ it _ 's _ not _ it _ 's _ not _ music _
it E 's E just E it _ 's _ just _ uh E uh E talking _ in _ a _ beat _
it E is E just E it _ 's _ not _ exciting _ at _ all _
yeah _
it E does E n't E it _ does _ n't _ give _ you _ relaxation _
yeah _
you _ ca _ n't _ dance _ to _ it _
you _ ca _ n't _ do _ anything _ to _ it _
right _
but E i E and _ i _ love _ i _ like _ orchestra _ music _ too _ like _ the _ boston _ pops _ or E or _ anything _
yeah _
yeah _
have _ you _ ever _ been _ to E the E to E to _ the _ dallas _ symphony _
uh-huh _
have _ you _
is _
are E are _ they _ good _
yeah _
yeah _
they _ 're _ good _
are _ they _
i E i _ have _ i _ have _ never _ been _
and _ uh _ we _ went _ and _ saw _ uh _ les _ miserables _
oh _ really _
oh _ the _ music _ in _ that _ was _ fantastic _
i E i _ 've _ heard _ i _ 've _ heard _ that _ that _ is _ a _ really _
yeah _
i _ heard _ that _ was _ hard _ to _ get _ tickets _ to _
yeah _
it E it _ uh E
i _ ca _ n't _ remember _ how _ far _ in _ advance _ we _ reserved _ tickets _
but _ it _ was _ out E you _ know _ out _ at _ the _ state _ fair _ music _ hall _
and _ uh _ it _ was _ well _ worth _ the _ price _
yeah _
yeah _
that _ was _ a _ real _
was _ it _
yeah _
i E i _ bet _ it _ was _
yeah _
i E i _ really _ bet _ it _ was _
is _ that _ the _ only _ uh _ musical _
do _ you _ go _ see _ a _ lot _ of _ musicals _
just E just _ ever _ so _ often _ you _ know _ a E real E a _ real _ good _ one _ like _ that _ one _
yeah _
and _
that E that _ would _ be _ that _ would _ be _ nice _
i _ went _ and _ saw _ uh _ i _ think _ it _ was _ uh _ sugar _ babies _
that _ was _ good _
that _ had _ good _ music _ in _ it _
was _ it _
how E how _
i E ca E n't E i _ do _ n't _ know _ what _ that _ 's _ about _
uh _ that _ was _ the _ one _ with _ mickey _ rooney _
and _ uh E oh E what _ 's _ that _ real E oh E not _ real _ old _ my _ wife _ she _ is _ old _ too _ dancer _ uh E
i _ ca _ n't _ think _ of _ her _ name _
i _ got _ it _ right _ on _ the _ tip _ of _ my _ tongue _ and _ ca _ n't _ say _ it _ helen _ something _
uh E uh E uh E i _ think _ i E know E who E you E 're E oh E i _ know _ who _ you _ 're _ talking _ about _
real _ long _ legs _ and _ dark _ hair _
she _ 's _ got _ black _ hair _
yeah _
okay _
i _ know _ who _ your _ talking _ about _
i _ ca _ n't _ think _ ever _ her _ name _ either _
i _ ca _ n't _ think _ of _ it _
yeah _
that E that _ was _ that _ was _
i _ remember _ that _ being _ uh _ here _ a _ few _ years _ ago _
yeah _
but _ uh _
oh _ oh _ the _ last _ country _ music _
my E my _ parents _ still _ uh E really _ like _ country _ music _
yeah _
and _ they E they _ like _ uh E they _ like _ the _ oak _ ridge _ boys _ and _ the _ statler _ brothers _
oh _ yeah _
yeah _
and E and _ uh E well E my E my _ my _ my _ parents _
the _ blackwoods _
yeah _
my _ husband _ likes _ uh _ country _ music _ real _ well _
and _ he E he _ likes _ some _ of _ the _ new _ groups _ like _ shenandoah _
yeah _
and _ yeah _
he _ really _ likes _ shenandoah _
alabama _
yeah _
yeah _
well _ yeah _
alabama _
uh _
i E think E i _ think _ they _ 're _ a _ bit _ over _ exposed _
yeah _
i _ get E kind E of E get _ tired _ of _ every _ other _ song _ being _ alabama _ on _ the _ radio _
yeah _
either _ alabama _ or _ hank _ williams _ junior _
oh E i E i _ 've _ never _ cared _ for _ hank _ williams _ junior _
i _ never _ have _ either _
and _ i _ never _ have _ figured _ out _ how _ he _ won _ uh _ entertainer _ of _ the _ year _ for _ about _ three _ or _ four _ years _ in _ a _ row _
oh _
oh E we E we _ watch _ those _ award _ shows _ too _
we _ enjoy _ watching _ the _ country _ and _ the _ grammies _ and _ stuff _
but _ i E just E i _ just _ do _ n't _ care _ for _ him _
yeah _
i _ just _ never _ have _
i _ do _ n't _
i _ guess _ probably _ my _ favorite _ all _ time _ country _ and _ western _ song _ or _ singer _ is _ uh _ probably _ eddy _ arnold _
is E is _ it _
uh-huh _
okay _
i E i _ think _ i E i _ know _ who _ that _ is _
uh-huh _
i _ think _ my _ parents _ have E have _ uh E some _ of _ his _ records _
but _ uh E i E got E a E i _ 've _ got _ about _ a _ hundred _ and _ or _ had _ a E uh E some _ uh E i _ sold _ some _ of _ them _ i _ had _ about _ a _ hundred _ and _ fifty _ old _ seventy-eight _ r _ p _ m _ records _ of _ country _ and _ western _ songs _
yeah _
wow _
smiley _ burnette _ i _ do _ n't _ know _ if _ you _ were _ old _ enough _ to _ remember _ him E him _
i _ 've _ heard _ the _ name _
he _ was E uh E played _ in _ the _ old _ western _ movies _
he _ was _ the _ sidekick _ of _ gene _ autry _ i _ believe _
huh _
or _ they _
i _ think _ his _ name _ in E in _ the _ movie _ was _ froggy _
and _
i E 've E i _ 've _ never _ seen _ a _ gene _ autry _ movie _
had _ a _ real _ raspy _ voice _
huh _
and _ uh _
no _
i _ never _ have _
some _ of _ those _ old _ ones _ of _ course _ bob _ wills _ miss _ texas _ playboys _ ernest _ tubbs _ and _ red _ foley _ an _
yeah _
yeah _
those _ go _ back _ quite _ a _ way _
yeah _
i _ took _ them _ up _ here _ to _ collectors _ records _ and _ was _ able _ to _ get _ a _ little _ money _ for _ them _
yeah _
but _ uh _ my _ mother _ and _ dad _ use _ to _ uh _ own _ a _ restaurant _
it _ 's _ hard _ to _
oh _ yeah _
and _ he E had E uh E they _ had _ a _ uh E nickelodeon _ of _ course _ in _ the _ restaurant _
yeah _
and _ when _ they _ would _ come _ and _ change _ the _ records _ the E guys E would E the _ guy _ would _ give _ her _ the _ old _ records _
well _ that _
that _ 's _ neat _
so _ that _ 's _ where _ i _ got _ my _
that _ would _ be _ great _ if _ they _ were _ n't _ too _ worn _ out _ at _ the _ time _
yeah _
of _ course _ there _ 's _ not _ a _ whole _ lot _ of _ market _ for _ seventy-eight _ r _ p _ m _ records _
is _ there _ not _
you E you _ 'd _ well E you _ 'd _ think _ there _ would _ be _
well E the _ problem _ is _ most _ of _ the _ record _ players _ now _ will _ not _ play _ them _ because _ you _ have _ to _ have _ that E needle E that _ uh E particular _ kind _ of _ needle _
well _ that _ 's _ true _
oh _ yeah _
and _ uh _ they _ just _ wo _ n't _ play _ on _ a _ modern _ day _ uh _ phonograph _
well _ that _ 's _ a _ shame _
because _ i E i _ we _ go _ to _ antique _ stores _ a _ lot _
and _ you _ see _ seventy-eights _ a E a _ lot _ at E at _ the _ stores _ at _ record _ stores _
yeah _
you _ 'd _ think _ there _ 'd _ be _ a _ market _ for _
yeah _
i E 'm E i _ 'm _ sure _ you _ could _ find _ old _ players _ for _ them _
but _ that _ would _ cost _ a _ fortune _ if _ you _ could _ find _ them _ that _ worked _
yeah _
yeah _
oh _
of _ course _ they _ you _ know _ just _ do _ n't _ have _ the _ quality _ of _ records _ nowadays _ either _ because _ you E you _ get _ that _ scratchy _ sound _
no _
uh-huh _
well _ those _ things _ were _ big _ and _ thick _ were _ n't _ they _
yeah _
yeah _
you _ could _ kill _ somebody _ with _ them _
yeah _
warped _ real _ easy _
and _ the _ ones _ you _ buy _
go _ out _ and _ buy _ one _ now _
and _ they _ 're _ just _ so _ thin _ and _ flimsy _
yeah _
and _ they E just E they _ 're _ not _ meant _ to _ last _ at _ all _
yeah _
neither _ are _ tapes _
i E i _ we _ buy _ cassette _ tapes _
yeah _
and _ machines _ will _ eat _ them _
yeah _
and _ so _ the _ best _ bet _ any _ these _ days _ are _ compact _ disk _
those _ things _ are _ practically _ indestructible _
but _ i E i _ guess _ you _ know _ the _ old _ country _ and _ western _ music _ you _
back _ then _ when _ i _ was _ a _ kid _ there _ was _ n't _ that _ much _ t _ v _
oh _ no _
so _ that _ 's _ all _ you _ had _ to _ listen _ to _ was _ the _ radio _
radio _
and _ uh _
that _ 's _ just E what E just _ what _ you _ had _
plus _
yeah _
i _ think _ it _ was _ better _ back _ then _ to _
there _ 's _ too _ much _ t _ v _ now _
yeah _
and _ the _ radio _ is _ you _ know _ more _ exciting _ really _ than E than _ television _
yeah _
your _ imagination _
yeah _
kept _
and _
it _ just _ did _ n't _ vegetate _ your _ mind _ like _ television _ does _
yeah _
i _ remember _ mother _ and _ dad _ always _ turned _ on _ the _ grand _ ole _ opera _
oh _ yeah _
yeah _
was _ it _ on _ the _ radio _ every _ week _
yeah _
what E day E what _ day _ was _ that _ on _
do E you E can _ you _ recall _
uh _ uh _ seems _ like _ it _ was _ on _ a _ friday _
uh _
friday _ or _
okay _
okay _
well _ what _ do _ you _ think _ about _ the _ idea _ of _ uh _ kids _ having _ to _ do _ public _ service _ work _ for _ a _ year _
do _ you _ think _ it _ 's _ a _
well E i E i _ think _ it _ 's _ a _ pretty _ good _ idea _
i _ think _ they _ should _ either _ do _ that _ or E or _ afford _ some _ time _ to _ the _ military _ or E or _ helping _ elderly _ people _
yes _
yes _
i E i _ you _ know _ i _ think _ that _ we _ have _ a _ bunch _ of _ elderly _ folks _ in _ the _ country _ that _ could _ use _ some _ help _
and _ i _ think _ that _ before _ we _ expend _ all _ our _ young _ talent _ overseas _ and E and _ helping _ other _ countries _ we _ ought _ to _ perhaps _ give _ a _ little _ bit _ of _ our _ help _ to _ our _ own _ folks _ at _ home _
and _ i _ 'm _ not _ sure _ that _ that _ 's _ not _ a _ bad _ idea _
that _ 's _ true _
and E or _ the _ military _ for _ a _ year _ or _ two _ would _ n't _ be _ bad _ for _
yeah _
i _ think _ it _ teaches _ kids _ how _ to _ grow _
how _ about _ yourself _
uh _ i _ agree _ with _ you _
uh _ uh _ what _ i _ 'm _ thinking _ about _ is _ back _ well _ when _ i _ was _ a _ kid _ and _ much _ earlier _ than _ that _ kids _ were _ kind _ of _
you _ know _ the _ parents _ kind _ of _ pushed _ them _ to _ join _ like _ the _ boy _ scouts _ or _ girl _ scouts _
and _ they _ did _ do E do _ do _ a _ lot _ of _ public _ service _ activities _
but _ these _ days _ they _ 're _ not _ uh _
parents _ are _ n't _ encouraging _ their _ kids _ to _ do _ things _ like _ that _
because _ when _ i _ was _ in _ the _ girl _ scouts _ we _ did _ a _ lot _ of _ public _ service _ things _ because _ that _ 's _ just _ part _ of E of _ the _ scouting _ and _ you _ know _
yeah _
i E 've E i _ 've _
that _ 's _ really _ great _
i E i _ really _ think _ that _ both _ the _ boy _ scouts _ and _ girl _ scouts _ is _ a E excellent E two _ excellent _ organizations _
they _ are _
but _ parents _
you _ know _ kids _ seem _ like _ when _ they _ get _ ten _ or _ twelve _ years _ old _ they _ fall _ out _ of _ that _
yeah _
they _ do _
and _ they _ do _ n't _ follow _ it _ at _ all _ you _ know _
there _ are _ very _ few _ scouts _ go _ on _ and _ become _ eagle _ scouts _
oh _ no _
and E and _ i _ do _ n't _ know _ what _ the _ high _ rank _ is _ for _ the _ gals _
but _
i E i _ uh E
senior _
oh _
senior _
okay _
so _ there _ 's _ not _ uh _
oh _ they _ 're _ just _ not _
once _ they _ get _ into _ junior _ high _ it _ just _ not _ done _ anymore _
yeah _
they E they _ lose _ interest _
and _ then _ when _ they _ young E young _ adults _ there _ 's _ even _ less _ interest _ there _
uh-huh _
they _ 're _ more _ for _ i _
me _
not E not _
yeah _
grab _
grab _
grab _
walk _ out _
yeah _
you _ 're _ absolutely _ right _
yeah _
i _ think _ it _ 's _ a E really _ a _ good _ thing _
i E i _ like _ to _ see _
of _ course _ there _ 's _ you _ know _ third _ world _ countries _ that _ can _ use _ all _ kind _ of _ help _
yeah _
but _ there _ 's _ a _ lot _ that _ can _ be _ done _ right _ here _ in _ this _ country _ too _
but _ i _ think _ we _ ought _ to _ start _ right _ here _ at _ home _
i _ 'm _ you _ know _
yeah _
uh E i E 'm E not E i _ 'm _ not _ so _ sure _ that _ overseas E help E helping _ overseas _ would _ be _ such _ a _ hot _ idea _ for E for _ uh E a _ lot _ of _ young _ people _
no _
it E it _
but _ since _ there _ is _ much _ that _ needs _ to _ be _ done _ here _
i E think E that E yeah E i _ think _ that _ we _ need _ to _ really _ address _ what _ we _ 've _ done _ here _
and E and _ then _ perhaps _ even _ a _ six _ month _ tour _ overseas _ that _ gives _ them _ much _ broader _ outlook _
uh-huh _
well _ it _ 's _ been _ really _ good _
we _ talked _ about _ this _ for _ a _ few _ minutes _
and _ uh _ hopefully _ we _ 'll _ have _ other _ good _ topic _ maybe _ another _ call _ someday _
but _ i E i _ do _ n't _ really _ have _ too _ much _ more _ to _ say _ on _ this _ topic _ i _ guess _
no _
i E i _ agree _ with _ you _
it E we _ i _ guess _ we _ both _ agree _ that _ it _ 's _ a _ good _ thing _ that _ they _ should _ do _ sometime _
yeah _
okay _
well _ you _ take _ care _
and E and _ enjoy _ the _ day _
you _ too _
you _ too _
thank _ you _ ma'am _
bye-bye _
bye-bye _
do E are _ you _ on _ a _ regular _ exercise _ program _ right _ now _
yes _
and _ i _ hate _ it _
how _ about _ you _
oh _ well _ i _ 'm _ kind _ of _ off _ and _ on _
off _ and _ on _
well _ i _ guess _ i _ 've _ been _ kind _ of _ off _ and _ on _
i _ 've _ uh _ had _ some _ health _ problems _ that _ have _ led _ me _ to _ uh _
right _ now _ i _ 'm _ kind _ of _ off _
i _ 'd _ say _ more _ on _ than _ off _
okay _
what _ type _ of _ exercise _ do _ you _ do _
uh _ i _ do _ walking _ on _ the _ treadmill _
and _ then _ i _ do _ low _ impact _ aerobics _
okay _
i _ guess _ you _ do _ n't _ enjoy _ that _ very _ much _
not E not _ really _
do _ you _ find _ that _ uh _ to _ be _ boring _
yeah _
and _ time _ consuming _
i _ mean _ it _ 's _ not _ just _ the _ exercise _ that _ 's _ boring _ and _ time _ consuming _
it _ 's _ uh _ you _ know _ afterwards _ you _ know _
then _ you _ have _ to _ take _ a _ shower _ and _ get _ cleaned _ up _ you _ know _
yeah _
well _ i _ 'm _ trying _ to _ get _ back _ in _ shape _ for _ softball _ this _ spring _
oh _ yeah _
but _ i _
do E you E go E through E this E is _ this _ something _ that _ you _ go _ through _ every _ year _
yeah _
i _ have _ n't _ decided _ whether E whether _ i _ want _ to _ play _ yet _ or _ not _
i _ just _ bought _ myself _ a _ solo _ flex _ machine _
i _ do _ n't _ know _ if _ you _ 've _ seen _ those _ advertised _ on _ t _ v _
uh-huh _
it _ 's _ one _ of _ those _ uh E universal _ type _ machines E exercise _ machines _
but _ i _ have _ n't _ really _ sat _ down _ and _ used _ it _ match _ yet _
so _ it _ 's _ collecting _ dust _ right _ now _
yeah _
a _ lot _ of _ things _ do _ that _
i E had E an E i _ had _ an _ exercise _ bike _
i _ used _ to _ jog _ somewhat _
i _ use _ to _ have _ one _
and _ i _ finally _ got _ rid _ of _ sit _ cause _ i _ never _ used _ it _
but _ i _ do _ use _ my _ treadmill _
uh-huh _
well _ that _ 's _ good _
yeah _
my _ parents _ have _ a _ treadmill _
it _ 's _
when _ i _ go _ visit _ them _ uh _ i _ get _ on _ that _ thing _ every _ now _ and _ then _
yeah _
it _ 's _ nice _ because _ when _ the _ weather _ 's _ bad _ you E ca E n't E you _ do _ n't _ have _ any _ excuse _
uh-huh _
i _ just _ got _ the _ bicycle _ out _ today _
and _ it _ was _ real _ nice _ outside _
had _ to _ get _ out _ to _ do _ something _
yeah _
i _ ca _ n't _ ride _ a _ bike _
so _
i _ 've _ been _ sitting _ in _ here _ in _ the _ house _ all _ weekend _ with _ a _ cold _
so _ thought _ i _ better E better _ get _ outside _ and _ do _ something _ and _ not _ waist _ the _ day _
oh _
yeah _
it _ 's _ too _ nice _
it _ 's _ been _ too _ nice _ all _ weekend _
but _ uh _ yeah _
i _ need _ to _ start _ jog E something _ again _
i _ 've _ always _ of _ that _ to _ be _ uh _ really _ one _ of _ the _ best _ forms _ of _ exercise _
but _ it _ 's _ terribly _ boring _
and _ so _ i _ really _ do _ n't _ ever _ keep _ a _ program _ up _ consistently _
have _ you _ ever _ had _ any _ injuries _ from _ jogging _
no _
i _ never _ have _
well _ i _ do _ n't _ job _ enough _ i _ think _ to _ develop _ any _ injuries _
i _ usually _ only _ go _ about _ a _ mile _ or _ two _
i _ guess _ it _ worries _ me _ about _ jogging _ it _ 's _ that _ i _ hear _ that _ it _ 's _ very _ hard _ on _ your _ body _ and E and _ that _ you _ know _ you _ can _ end _ up _ getting _ hurt _ worse _
yeah _
it E 's E it _ 's _ tough _ on _ the _ joints _ if _ you _ jog _ on _ concrete _ or _ on _ asphalt _
uh-huh _
suppose _ to _ be _ much _ better _ if _ you _ find _ grass _ uh E or E or _ dirt _ to _ jog _ on _
yeah _
that _ 's _ not _ quite _ so E so _ easy _
you _ have _ to _ have _ the _ right _ type _ of _ shoes _ too _
that _ 's _ very _ important _
yeah _
yeah _
i _ found _ that _ true _ especially _ from _ walking _ on _ toe _ and _ fronts _
but _
yeah _
i _ do _ n't _ have _ to _ buy _ jogging _ shoes _ all _ to _ often _
my _ do _ n't _ get _ very _ much _ use _
well E i _ guess _ my _ breakdown _ about E they _ say _ about _ every _ six _ months _
uh-huh _
i _ usually _ enjoy _ the _ exercise _ i _ do _
but _ uh E like _ i _ said _ i _ 'm _ just _ not _ very _ consistent _ about _ maintaining _ a E a _ program _
so _ i E 'll E i _ 'll _ bicycle _
i _ get _ into _ that _ for E for _ a _ little _ while _ and _ maybe _ go _ out _ uh E on _ a _ consistent _ basis _ every _ couple _ of _ days _ and _ ride _ a _ bike _ for _ awhile _
but _ then _ i _ 'll _ get _ tired _ of _ doing _ that _ and _ maybe _ start _ jogging _ again _ and _ go _ out _ about _ three _ or _ four _ nights _ a _ week _
but _ uh _ that _ gets _ old _ too _ in _ a _ very _ short _ order _
yeah _
i E 'm E i _ 'm _ hoping _ that _ this _ uh E solo _ flex _ will _ uh E uh E change _ things _ a _ little _ bit _
i _ really _ need _ to _ get _ on _ a _ regular _ type _ of _ program _ and _ use _ that _ thing _ on _ a _ consistent _ basis _
yeah _
well _ do _ n't _ let _ it _ collect _ dust _
at _ least _ exercise _ while _ dusting _ it _ off _
yeah _
well _
maybe _ if _ i _ can _ get _ interested _ in _ playing _ softball _ again _ this _ string _ i _ can _ uh _ start _ some _ type _ of _ uh _ regular _ program _
yeah _
that E that _ 'll _ be _ good _
i _ 've _ always _ found _ that _ uh E when _ you _ write _ things _ down _ and _ set _ goals _ it _ 's _ a _ lot _ easier _ to _ keep E uh E keep _ something _ going _
uh-huh _
uh _ when _ i _ was _ in _ high _ school _ we _ had _ a _ choice _ of _ uh _ taking _ uh _ physical _ education _ courses _ on _ exercise _
an _ uh _ one _ of _ those _ involved _ a _ six _ weeks _ session _ on _ a _ universal _ machine _ lifting _ weights _ and _ uh _ working _ out _ like _ that _
oh _
and _ that _ was _ very _ helpful _
we _ kept _ charts _ of _ our _ progress _ and _ uh _ consistently _ increased _ the _ empty _ of _ resistance _ so _ you _ could _ see _ how _ much _ you _ improved _ over _ the _ weeks _
uh-huh _
i _ found _ that _ to _ be _ uh _ very _ helpful _
are _ you _ going _ to _ do _ that _
uh _ i _ need _ to _
i _ have _ n't _ started _ yet _
but _ uh _ it _ 's _ a _ thought _
well _ that _ sounds _ like _ something _ good _ to _ do _ then _
sounds _ like _ something _ i _ should _ do _
yeah _
nice _ way _ to _ start _ off _ this _ spring _ get _ back _ in _ shape _
how _ often _ do _ you _ uh _ uh _ go _ out _ each _ week _ on _ your _ walking _
well _ i _ do _
i _ switch _ every _ other _ day _
one _ day _ i _ walk _
and _ one _ day _ i _ do _ the _ aerobics _
okay _
how E far E about _ how _ far _ do _ you _ go _ walking _
well _ i _ 'm _ trying _ to _ get _ my _ tolerance _ now _
i _ just _ had _ surgery _ um _ less _ then _ two _ months _ ago _
and _ right _ now _ i _ 'm _ just _ a _ little _ over _ about _ a _ mile _ and _ a _ half _
okay _
but _ i _ 'm _ trying _ to _ workup _ to _ three _ miles _
well _ that _ 's _ good _
well _ they _ say _ that _ walking _ is _ just _ as _ good _ if _ not _ better _ then _ jogging _
yeah _
it _
it E takes E it _ 's _ just _ that _ it _ takes _ longer _ to _ get _ to _ the _ same _ effect _
sure _
yeah _
but _
well _ if _ you _ keep _ up _ with _ a _ consistent _ pace _ just _ to _ uh _ keep _ the _ heart _ rating _ going _ uh _
my _ walkman _ broke _
yeah _
so _ i _ 'm _ upset _
and _ i _ just _ have _ to _ turn _ to _ stereo _ up _ real _ loud _
yeah _
but _ it _ 's _ a _ lot _ less _ stressful _ on _ the _ joints _ then _ jogging _ is _
yeah _
it _ is _
and _ this _ does _ n't _ you _ know _
my _ treadmill _ has _ an _ incline _
and _ you _ know _ you _ can _ get _ a _ really _ good _ workout _ on _ it _
um _ do _ you _ go _ to _ an _ aerobics _ class _
or _ do _ you _ watch _ on _ t _ v _
no _
i E i _ just _ do _ it _ on _ t _ v _
okay _
i _ have _ a _ cassette _
which _ uh _ shows _ do _ you _ watch _ on _ t _ v _
um E it E 's E a E it _ 's _ a _
i _ use _ tapes _
oh _ okay _
okay _
like _ a _ cathy _ smith _ workout _
or E or _ richard _ simmons _
or _ jane _ fonda _
okay _
sweating _ to _ the _ oldies _
right _
i E every _ now _ and _ then _ i _ 'll _ watch _ e _ s _ p _ n _
i _ get _ cable _ on _ t _ v _
uh-huh _
and _ they _ have _ uh _ a _ couple _ of _ shows _ called _ basic _ training _
and _ uh _ what _ is _ the _ other _ one _ called _
there _ was _ one _ guy _ i _ use _ to _ watch _ on _ e _ s _ p _ n _
i _ do _ n't _ know _ if _ he _ 's _ still _ on _ any _ more _ or _ not _
i E i _ do _ n't _ know _ if _ i _ get _ e _ s _ p _ n _ or _ not _
uh-huh _
but _ uh _ one _ you _ know _
i _ use _ to _ watch E one E watch _ one _ on _ the _ air _
but _ that _ was _ back _
bodies _ in _ motion _ that E 's E that _ 's _ the _ name _ of _ the _ one _ i _ was _ thinking _ of _ with _ gill _
that _ 's _ was _
yeah _
yeah _
yeah _
i _ watched _ that _ cause _ he _ was _ cute _
yeah _
he _ 's _ not _ bad _
his _ assistants _ usually _ are _ n't _ either _
but _ uh _
they _ 're _ always _ in E in _ hawaii _ some _ place _ on E on _ the _ beach _
yeah _
yeah _
but _ then _ that _ was _ back _ when _ uh _ you _ know _ the _ high _ impact _ and _
yeah _
well E they E they _ do _ low _ i _ pact _ stuff _ now _
do _ they _
are _
yeah _
they E 're E still E they _ 're _ still _ he _ 's _ still _ doing _ it _ then _ uh E
yeah _
every _ morning _
i _ 'll _ have _ to _ tune _ in _
it _ 's _ on _ e _ s _ p _ n _ uh _
at _ what _ time _
i _ ca _ n't _ remember _ what _ time _
it _ 's _ uh _ you _ know _
i _ ca _ n't _ remember _ offhand _ what _ time _
i _ 'll _ have _ to _ check E it E check E check _ check _ it _ back _ up _
yeah _
and E but _ the _ thing _ is _ everybody _ always _ looks _ so _ good _ on _ that _ show _ at _ least _ on _
yeah _
every _ now _ and _ then _
not _ everybody _ has _ a _ picture _ perfect _ body _
uh-huh _
well E i _ found _ that _ they E they _ have _ just _ a _ much _ better _ program _ than _ the _ other _ shows _ that _ are _ on _ t _ v _
i _ have _ n't _ watch _ any _ other _ ones _ on _ t _ v _ watch=watched _ just _ on _ some _ of _ the _ tapes _
they _ 're _ on _ weekdays _ at _ eleven _ o'clock _ every _ day _ monday _ through _ friday _ incase _ you _ 're _ interested _ in _ that _
okay _
thanks _
but _ uh _ i _ have _ n't _ done _ so _ much _ as _ uh _ watch _ the _ tape _ that _ i _ made _
now _ that _ 's _ a _ thought _
so _ i _ 'm _ kind _ of _ bad _ about _ that _ myself _
well _ that _ 's _ thought _
i _ have _ n't _ thought _ about _ that _
well _ they _ 're _ going _ to _ beep _ us _ pretty _ soon _
okay _
well _ i _ sure _ enjoyed _ to _ you _ about _ exercise _ and _ fitness _
nice _ talking _ to _ you _ too _
okay _
thanks _
so _ all _ right _
talk _ to _ you _ later _
good _ night _
bye _
bye _
uh _ well _ what _ would _ you _ say _ your _ opinion _ is _ on _ gun _ control _
well _ i _ do _ n't _ know _
i E 've E i _ 've _ had _ mixed _ emotions _ i _ guess _ when _ i _ listen _ to _ uh E the _ radio _ and E and _ watch _ t _ v _ about _ the _ different _ uh E things _ that _ are _ happening _
uh _ i _ 'm _ against _ it _
but _ on _ the _ same _ token _ uh _ i _ went _ out _ and _ purchased _ a _ gun _ just _ because _ i _ wanted _ the _ right _ to _ do _ that _
so _ i E i _ have _ a _ rifle _ in _ the _ house _
uh _ the _ ammunition _ is _ probably _ so _ old _ i _ 'm _ afraid _ to _ use _ it _
but _ uh E i _ bought _ it _ for _ target _ practicing _ and E uh E and _ also _ because _ i _ wanted _ a _ weapon _
uh _ how _ do _ you _ feel _ about _ it _
well _ i _ think _ uh _ down _ here _ in _ texas _ they _ do _ n't _ have _ a _ waiting _ period _ on _ handguns _
huh _
and _ i _ think _ they _ need _ that _
uh E and _ i E do E have E a E i _ have _ a _ pistol _
it _ 's _ a _ little _ twenty-two _
and _ i _ have _ a E twenty-two E or E a _ twelve _ gauge _ shotgun _
uh-huh _
you _ know _ i _ do _ like _ to _ have _ my _ guns _
uh _ i _ do _ n't _ know _ if _ i _ 'll _ ever _ use _ it _ you _ know _
and _ like _ you _ my _ bullets _ to _ my _ little _ pistol _ 's _ probably _ uh _ about _ three _ years _ old _
uh _ my _ gun _ has _ n't _ been _ shot _ in _ a _ year _ or _ two _
uh-huh _
but _ uh E i _ like _ to _ have _ them _ where E handy _
well E up E uh E up _ in _ new _ england _ where _ i _ 'm _ from _ uh E you _ had _ to _ get _ a _ permit _ before _ you _ could _ buy _ any _ ammunition _
and _ i _ thought _ that _ was _ really _ good _
and _ i _ think _ if _ they _ uh _
takes _ two _ weeks _ for _ that _ system _ to _ process _ uh E your _ request _ for E uh E not _ as _ a _ gun _ permit _ but E uh E but _ to _ buy _ ammunition _
you _ have _ to _ get _ a _ permit _ from _ the _ police _ station _ in _ your _ local _ area _ to _ do _ that _
i _ 've _ never _ heard _ of _ anything _ like _ that _
yeah _ uh _
that _ would _ be _ nice _
but _ you _ know _
the _ criminals _ that _ are _ going _ to _ get _ their _ guns _ one _ way _ or _ the _ other _
i E i _ i _ agree _
i _ think _ you _ know _ one _ of _ the _ things _ that E that _ that _ needs _ to _ happen _ is _ uh E to E to _ stop _ the _ impulse _ buyer _ from _ uh E buying _ it _ quickly _ and E and _ uh E maybe _ putting _ a _ week _ 's _ waiting _ period _ or _ something _ on _ it _
but _ if _ someone _ 's _ really _ determined _ to E to _ pick _ up _ a _ firearm _ you _ can _ pick _ it _ up _ any _ place _
yeah _
and _ you _ can _ get _ them _ really _ cheap _
i _ know _
i E i _ had _ a _ waiting _ period _ on _ my _ pistol _ because _ i _ was _ down _ in _ uh E tennessee _ and _ uh E they _ had _ a _ waiting _ period _
uh-huh _
and _ uh _ we _ bought _ it _ there _
and _
how _ long _ was _ the _ waiting _ period _ out _ there _
about _ nine _ days _
huh _
that _ was _ n't _ too _ too _ bad _
no _
no _
because _ if E if _ you _ 're _ going _ to _ go _ buy _ something _ uh E uh E of _ that _ nature _ i _ think _ you E you _ 're _ going _ to _ have _ some _ idea _ as _ to _ what _ you _ 're _ going _ to _ do _ with _ it _
you _ 're _ not _ going _ to _ react _ that _ quickly _
in _ other _ words _ you _ know _ you _ do _ n't _ have _ a _ need _ to _ go _ buy _ a _ gun _ to _ go _ shoot _ it _ the _ next _ day _
somebody _ wants _ to _ do _ that _
i E i _ at _ times _ i _ think _ they _ ought _ to _ have _ a _ waiting _ period _ on _ all _ firearms _
yeah _
i _ do _ too _ uh _ because _ it _ does _ n't _ make _ any _ difference _ uh _ uh _ whether _ it _ 's _ a _ pistol _ or _ a _ shotgun _ i _ suppose _
they _ both _ do _ the _ same _ kind _ of _ job _
a _ shotgun _ hurts _ worse _ than _ a _ pistol _ does _
uh _ yeah _
i _ suppose _
i _ never _ got _ shot _ with _ either _ one _
but _ i _ do _ n't _ know _ uh _
i _ think _ you _ could _ recover _ from _ a _ pistol _ but _ not _ from _ a _ shotgun _
no _
a _ shotgun _ 's _ got _ too _ much _ of _ a _ spread _
or _ at _ least _ ours _ does _
yeah _
uh _ it _ 's _ you _ know _
you _ have _ a _ little _ uh E thing _ on E the E bottom E of E on _ top _ of _ the _ barrel _ where _ you E you _ turn _ it _
uh-huh _
you _ can _ make _ it _ either _ tight _ or _ as _ loose _ as _ loose _ can _ get _
oh _
and _ the _ spread _ changes _
uh _ i _ 've _ got _ a _ manual _ single _ shot _
and _ i _ guess _ it _ does _ n't _ have _ any E any _ automatic _ features _ to _ it _
the _ further _ away _ i _ get _ the E the _ uh E wider _ the _ shot _ gets _ from _ the _ target _
yeah _
and _ the _ closer _ that _ i _ get _ the _ tighter _ that _ it _ gets _
it _ 's _ got _ a _ hell _ of _ a _ kick _ to _ it _
yeah _
my _ husband _ had _ a E uh E a _ police _ gun _ at _ one _ time _
and _ i _ shot _ that _ thing _ one _ time _
almost _ knocked _ me _ down _
and _ it _ just _ a _
i E i _ forget _
i _ think _ it _ was _ a _ three _ fifty-seven _
i _ 'm _ not _ sure _
do _ you _ belong _ to _ a _ gun _ club _ or _ you _
he _ belonged _ to _ one _ awhile _ back _
uh _ since _ we _ moved _
we _ 've _ only _ been _ here _ in _ texas _ for _ about _ a _ year _
uh-huh _
and _ uh _ we _ ca _ n't _ even _ find _ a _ place _ to _ shoot _ just _ for _ target _ practice _
no _ kidding _
i _ 'd _ love _ to _ get _ used _ to _ that _ shotgun _
we _ traded _ his _ pistol _ for _ that _ shotgun _
huh E well E the E the _ uh E clubs _ that _ we _ 've _ got _ around _ here _ are _ kind _ of _ expensive _
but _ uh _ it _ 's _ well _ worth _ it _
you _ can _ go _ down _ and _ shoot _ up _ against _ a _ sand _ bag _ and _ some _ targets _ and _ have _ uh _ competition _
uh _ i _ 've _ never _ really _ joined _ a _ club _ because _ i _ have _ n't _ got _ the _ time _ not _ because _ i _ have _ n't _ got _ the _ desire _
uh E there _ 's _ an _ annual _ membership _ fee _ uh E that E 's E that _ 's _ fairly _ high _
plus _ there _ 's _ an _ initiation _ fee _ that _ you _ have _ to _ pay _ because _ of _ first _ time _ uh _ uh _ member _
so _ the _ whole _ process _ can _ cost _ you _ a _ hundred _ fifty _ dollars _ to _ join _ the _ club _
plus _ you _ have _ to _ pay _ for _ the E the _ ammunition _ in _ any _ tournaments _ that _ you _ would _ join _ in _
yeah _
well _ that _ 's _ what _ my _ husband _
when _ he _ was _ in _ that _ gun _ club _ where _ he _ was _ doing _ that _ tell _ if _ it _ 's _ a _ cough _ or _ something _ was _
it _ you _ know _
he _ went _ mostly _ just _ to _ uh _ shoot _ at _ paper _ targets _
uh-huh _
uh _ but _ you _ know _ they _ used _ speed _ and _ accuracy _ and _ all _ that _
i _ think _ that E that _ the _ gun _ clubs _ serve _ a _ useful _ purpose _
in _ fact _ i _ 'd _ like _ to _ see _ somehow _ they _ tie _ the _ legislation _ into _ not _ only _ when _ you _ buy _ a _ weapon _ you _ have _ to _ uh _ show _ that _ you _ 've _ gone _ to _ school _ or _ gone _ to _ some _ class _ to _ know _ how _ to _ handle _ that _ weapon _
that _ 's _ a _ good _
i _ 've _ never _ thought _ of _ that _
that _ 's _ a _ good _ point _
and _ you _ know _ it E it _
even _ after _ you _ wait _ your _ nine _ days _ if _ you _ do _ n't _ know _ how _ to _ handle _ it _ it _ 's _ just _ like _ putting _ someone _ in _ an _ automobile _ that _ does _ n't _ know _ how _ to _ drive _
and _ you _ give _ him _ a _ license _ because _ he _ waited _ nine _ days _
yeah _
that _ 's _
and _ yeah _
he E could E he _ could _ not _ only _ uh E uh E shoot _ himself _
he E could E he _ could _ uh E mishandle _ a _ weapon _ leave _ it _ at _ home _ and _ let _ a _ child _ get _ at _ it _
it _
well E we E uh E we _ was _ living _ on _ a _ navy _ base _ down _ in _ memphis _
and _ uh _ this _ one _ guy _ decided _ to _ play _ uh _ lonesome _ cowboy _ or _ something _
and _ he _ was _ twirling _ his _ gun _ around _ and _ shot _ himself _ in _ his _ foot _
wow _
he _ was _ fortunate _
he E could E he _ could _ of _ hit _ something _ else _
well _ he _ went _ tumbling _ down _ the _ steps _ along _ with _ uh _ shooting _ his _ foot _ almost _ off _
he _ broke _ his _ leg _ and _ collar _ bone _ and _ a _ couple _ of _ other _ things _ i _ 'm _ sure _ being _ mister _ cowboy _
wow _
i _ ca _ n't _ remember _ what _ the E the _ term _ was _ going _ around _
it _ was _ about _ four _ or _ five _ years _ ago _
but _ now _ i _ guess _ that _ would _ be _ a _ good _ idea _
about _ uh _ private _ citizens _ selling _ a _ weapons _
like _ if _ you _ wanted _ to _ sell _ your _ pistol _ to _ me _
how _ do _ you _ feel _ about _ that _
do _ you _ believe _ there _ ought _ to _ be _ legislation _ guiding _ the _ uh _ buyer _ and _ the _ seller _
and E or _ do _ you _ believe _ that _ you _ ought _ to _ be _ able _ to _ sell _ your _ system _ uh E because _ you _ own _ it _
uh _ that _ 's _ a _ hard _ one _ because _ we _ did _ that _
but _ uh _ i _ think _ there _ ought _ to _ be _ some _ rule _ against _ it _
i _ 'll _ uh _ you _ know _
the _ person _ who _ sells _ the _ gun _ ought _ to _ protect _ themselves _ because _ if _ that _ gun _ 's _ registered _ to _ them _ and _ somebody _ else _ uses _ that _ gun _ in _ something _ the _ cops _ are _ going _ to _ come _ to _ you _
yeah _
is _ n't _ there _ a _ way _ to E uh E to _ deregister _ yourself _ after _ you _ register _ a _ gun _
uh _
i _ have _ no _ idea _
i _ 've _ only _ had _ one _ gun _
because _ i _ have _
and _ i _ 've _ kept _ it _ you _ know _ the _ one _ gun _ that _ was _ in _ my _ name _
yeah _
is _ it _ registered _
yeah _
the E uh E the _ rifle _ that _ i _ 've _ got _ is _ not _ registered _
and _ uh _ i _ do _ n't _ know _ why _ i _ never _ registered _ it _
but _ the _ uh _
i _ do _ n't _ think _ you _ have _ to _ register _ a _ shotgun _
um E i E i _ think _ it E 's E it _ 's _ voluntary _
the E uh E the _
well _ see _ uh _ my _ husband _ has _ a _ thing _
if _ they _ go _ to _ uh E regulating E uh E all _ right _ uh E banning _ guns _ private _ citizens _
yeah _
this _
my _ kid _ is _ jumping _ on _ me _
i _ ca _ n't _ hardly _ talk _
my _ husband _ feels _ that _ they _ 'll _ come _ and _ collect _ everybody _ 's _ guns _
yeah _
i _ guess _ that _ could _ happen _
it _ 's _ just _ like _ the E uh E the _ social _ security _ system _
once _ they E uh E they _ gave _ everybody _ a _ number _
and _ now _ they _ 're _ making _ you _ uh E uh E get _ one _ at E at _ birth _
and _ once _ they _ have _ your _ number _ they _ have _ your _ identification _
yeah _
and _ if _ you _ try _ to _ do _ anything _ uh _ like _ uh _ not _ identify _ yourself _ to _ the _ government _ they _ know _ who _ you _ are _
yeah _
and _ everything _ about _ you _
and _ that _ 's _ true _
uh _ i _
you _ know _ they _ know _ so E how _ much _ money _ you _ make _ a _ week _ to _ uh E probably _ your _ uh E
my _ kid _ is _ banging _
i _ was _ seeing _ what _ they _ was _ banging _ on _
uh _ i _ 've _ lost _ my _ train _ of _ thought _
i _ 'm _ sorry _
that _ 's _ all _ right _
you E you _ were _ talking _ about _ uh E uh E what _ the _ federal _ government _ knows _ about _ people _
oh _ the _
yeah _
they E they _ probably _ know _ everything _ from _ half _ the _ time _ what _ time _ you _ go _ to _ the _ bathroom _
they _ probably _ do _
no _
that E 's E that _ 's _ a _ little _ bit _ extreme _
but _ they _ could _ know _ anything _ and _ everything _ about _ you _
and _ uh _ i _ 'd _ like _ to _ have _ my _ gun _
if _ they _ go _ to _ banding E banning _ them _ i _ 'd _ lose _ my _ gun _
but _ we _ would _ n't _ lose _ our E our _ uh E shotgun _
yeah _
and _ uh _ we _ 're _ wanting _ to _ get _ a _ couple _ of _ more _ that _ no _ one _ knows _ about _
uh-huh _
but _ i E do E n't E i _ do _ n't _ uh E
do _ you _ find _ it _ difficult _ picking _ up _ uh E guns _ that E that _ are _ not _ registered _
no _
no _
i _ do _ n't _ either _
i E can E i _ can _ buy _ some _ uh E today _ if _ i _ wanted _ to _
just _ you _ know _ put _ up _ the _ money _
yeah _
yeah _
well E you _ can _ look _ in _ the E uh E the _
we _ got _ a _ thing _ down _ here _ called _ a _ shopper _
uh-huh _
it E 's E a E a _ it _ 's _ a _ it _ 's _ a _ bargain _ thing _
uh _ you _ go _ and _ you _ know _ always _ see _ guns _ in _ there _ five _ to _ seven _ guns _ a _ day _
yeah _
it _ comes _ out _ every _ tuesday _
and _ there E 's E there _ 's _ no _ waiting _ period _ on _ that _
no _
none _ whatsoever _
you _ call _
we _ sold _ a _ refrigerator _ through _ it _
and _ it _ took _ us _ all _ of _ twelve _ hours _
to _ sell _ the _ refrigerator _
yeah _
yeah _
you _ know _ and _ i _ 'm _ sure _ it _ 'd _ be _ even _ less _ for _ somebody _ with _ a _ good _ gun _
huh E and _ i _ think _ the _ federal _ government _ is E uh E is _ really _ far _ away _ from _ uh E uh E control _
i E i _ do _ n't _ believe _ in _ uh E
i E 'm E i _ should _ n't _ probably _ say _ control _
i _ mean _ regulation _
control _ is _ something _ that _ i _ would _ n't _ want _ the _ federal _ government _ to _ have _
uh _ but _ i _ would _ like _ to _ see _ them _ have _ a _ monitoring _ capability _ so _ that _ they _ know _ who _ has _ what _ weapons _
yeah _
well _ i _ agree _ with _ you _ there _
they _ do _ have _ too _ much _ control _ over _ us _ already _
yeah _
uh _ we _ could _ look _ at _ our _ paychecks _ and _ see _ how _ much _ control _ they _ have _
unfortunately _ we E uh E we _ vote _ for _ the E the _ people _ who _ spend _ the _ money _
so _ i _ ca _ n't _ complain _ too _ much _
yeah _
i _ guess _ so _
i _ do _ n't _ know _
they _ 're _
well _ i _ have _ n't _ heard _ anything _ about _ the _ proposal _ myself _
but _ uh E uh E i _ do _ n't _ know _ if _ its E their _ proposal _ or _ one _ that _ 's _ being _ seriously _ kicked _ around _
no _
i _ have _ n't _ either _
i E 've E i _ 've _ always _ felt _ for _ a _ long _ time _ that _ i E i _ think _ that _ all _ young _ kids _ ought _ to _ do _ a _ stint _ uh E primarily _ in _ the _ military _
yeah _
uh _
most _ countries _ require _ that _ now _
they E you _ know _ they _ have _ uh E it _ mandatory _ for E for _ the E the _ uh E at _ least _ the _ young _ men _
yeah _
yeah _
uh-huh _
i _ do _ n't _ know _ about _ the _ young _ women _
i _ do _ n't _ know _ if _ they _ have _ to _ serve _ in _ the _ military _ too _
yeah _
a _ lot _
yeah _
well _ you _ take _ israel _
i _ mean _ everybody _ does _
yeah _
i _ do _ n't _ think _ it _ 's _ a _ bad _ idea _
teaches E teaches _ a _ lot _
i _ mean _ i _ went _ in _ the _ service _ when _ i _ was _ eighteen _ and _ uh _ stayed _ in _ for _ ten _ years _
uh-huh _
is _ that _ right _
yeah _
uh _ did _ a _ lot _ of _ growing _ up _
i _ bet _
you _ have _ to _
yeah _
yeah _
my _ father _ had _ been _ in _ the _ military _
i _ did _ n't _ do _ it _ myself _
my _ father _ had _
and _ that _ 's _ uh _ how _ he _ put _ himself _ through _ school _ basically _
yeah _
he _ came _ from _ a _ poor _ immigrant _ family _
and _ he _ did _ n't _ have _ a _ chance _ to _ uh _ you _ know _
the _ family _ was _ n't _ wealthy _
so _ he _ had _ to _ do _ something _ to _ put _ himself _ through _ school _
do _ it _ himself _
and _ he _ did _
and _ he _ was _ very _ successful _
well _ my _ parents _ wanted _ to _ send _ me _ to _ college _
and _ i _ was _ dead _ set _ against _ it _
you _ know _ i _ had _ wanderlust _ you _ know _
yeah _
and _ i _ got _ in _
and _ after E after _ wasting _ the _ first _ six _ years _ partying _ and _ everything _ else _ i _ decided _ uh-huh E time _ to _ settle _ down _ and _ do _ something _
so _ i _ started _ to _ work _ on _ my _ education _
yeah _
course _ my _ job _ was _ such _ that _ i E did E n't E i _ could _ n't _ do _ it _ as _ much _ as _ i _ wanted _
uh-huh _
and _ still _ i _ ended _ up _ going _ two _ semesters _ when _ i _ got _ out _ just _ to _ get _ my _ degree _
that _ 's _ pretty _ good _
but _ i _ 've _ been _ in _ school _ ever _ since _
that _ 's _ good _
yeah _
i _ guess _
yeah _
that _ 's _ uh _
i _ do _ n't _ know _
there _ 's _ other _ kinds _ of _ service _ to _ the _ country _ that _ could _ be _ done _ you _ know _
yeah _
i _ mean _ if _ you _ do _ n't _ like _
i _ mean _ working _ in _ the _ national _ parks _ uh _ working _ clean _ up _ the _ roadsides _
sure _
exactly _
oh _ yeah _ absolutely _
i _ mean _
all E these E all _ this _ money _ that _ we _ 're _ throwing _ away _ to _ pay _ people _ to _ go _ out _ and _ do _ things _ when _ we _ 're _ paying _ all _ these _ welfare _ recipients _
and _ if _ they _ 're _ able-bodied _ people _ i _ do _ n't _ see _ any _ problem _ at _ all _ with _ having _ them _ go _ out _ there _ and E and _ if _ nothing _ else _ get _ a _ group _ of _ them _ together _ and _ take _ them _ around _ to _ old _ folks _ places _ and _ let _ them _ cut _ the _ yards _ paint _ the _ houses _
yeah _
yeah _
we _ 'd _ learn _ service _ to _ other _ people _ in _ this _ country _
sure _
sure _
so _ i _ 'm _
get _ something _ out _ of _ that _ money _
country _ would _ benefit _
yeah _
i _ 've _
i _ mean _ uh _
yeah _
yeah _
my _ next _ door _ neighbor _ when _ i _ was _ growing _ up _ worked _ for _ the _ unemployment _ division _
and _ his _ sole _ job _ was _ just _ tracking _ down _ people _ who _ were _ getting _ benefits _ and _ able-bodied _
and _
that _ right _
yeah _
and _ he E he _ had _ all _ kinds _ of _ horror _ stories _
you _ know _ these _ guys _ go _ down _ there _ and _ get _ their _ unemployment _ checks _
and _ back _ back _ in _ those _ days _ they _ also _ use _ to _ give _ you _ uh _ booklets _ good _ for _ uh _ clothing _ and _ gas _ and _ things _ like _ this _
yeah _
they _ get _ all _ this _ stuff _ together _ and _ sit _ down _ and _ have _ poker _ games _ you _ know _
yeah _
and _ i E 'm E i _ i _ have _ a _ hard _ time _ dealing _ with _ that _
what _ i _ hear _ one _ time _ i _ think _ it _ was _ on _ paul _ harvey _ 's _ uh _ radio _ segment _ that _ he _ said _ that _ if _ the _ money _ that _ goes _ into _ welfare _ each _ year _ was _ to _ be _ given _ directly _ to _ the _ people _ without _ all _ the _ middle _ people _ in _ the _ government _ bureaucracy _ each _ person _ would _ receive _ like _ forty-five _ thousand _ dollars _
uh-huh _
i _ mean _ i _ was _ astounded _
i _ do _ n't _ even _ make _ that _
no _
i _ know _
i E you _ you _ think _ about _ you _ think _ about _ the _ layer _ of _ bureaucracy _ between _ the _ money _ and _ the _ recipient _
yeah _
and _ somebody _ 's _ taking _ that _ away _
and E and _ there E 's E probably E there _ 's _ easily _ probably _ six _ or _ seven _ times _ that _ amount _ being _ spent _ on _ the _ bureaucracy _
yeah _
no _ doubt _
you _ know _ it E 's E it _ 's _ it _ 's _ totally _ ridiculous _
and _ now E i E i _ i _ uh E started _ out _ when _ i _ first _ got _ in _ graduate _ school _
i _ was _ going _ into _ public _ administration _
and _ uh _ quite _ honestly _ i _ just _ got _ so _ fed _ up _ with _ it _ i _ just _ could _ n't _ stand _ it _ any _ more _
is _ that _ right _
yeah _
i _ mean _ this _ is _ the _ kind _ of _ thing _ you _ look _ at _
yeah _
you _ sit _ there _
and _ when _ you _ 're _ writing _ up _ budgets _ you _ wonder _ okay _ how _ much _ money _ do _ we _ need _
well _ you _ need _ x _ number _ dollars _ for _ the _ recipients _
but _ you _ need _ x _ number _ dollars _ to _ administer _ the _ program _
well _ just _ ridiculous _
yeah _
this _ is _ ridiculous _
it _ 's _ sad _
it _ is _
it _ 's _ pathetic _
i _ mean _ there _ 's _ got _ to _ be _ a _ different _ way _
there _ 's _ got _ to _ be _ a _ better _ way _
but _ it _ 'll _ never _ happen _
i _ mean _ these E these _ people _ out _ here _ getting _ that _ money _ are _ big _ voting _ blocks _
yeah _
yeah _
what _ would _ happen _ if _ the _ required _ young _ people _ to _ do _ service _ to _ the _ country _
what _ should _ they _ get _ in _ return _ i _ wonder _
like _ uh _
i E think E i _ think _ there _ ought _ to _ be _ some _ kind _ of _ assistance _ as _ far _ as _ uh E
and _ i _ would _ limit _ it _ strictly _ to _ something _ like _ tuition _ assistance _
yeah _
give _ an _ incentive _
educational _ or _ vocational _ training _ or _ something _
yeah _
something _ that _ 's _ going _ to _ help _ them _ along _ the _ way _
and _ they _ 'll _ help _ the _ country _ eventually _ too _ because _ rather _ than _ having _ a _ bunch _ of _ uneducated _ people _ we _ can _ have _ educated _ people _
sure _
i _ mean _
well _ this _
i E mean E i _ mean _ look _ at _ the _ statistics _
and _ that _ 's _ only _ going _ to _ help _
i _ mean _ it _ 's _ sad _
one _ in _ five _ americans _ ca _ n't _ read _
yeah _
adults _ that _ is _ ca _ n't _ even _ read _
and E and _ we _ 've _ got _ the _ lowest _ rates _ of _ the _ civilized _ countries _ in _ science _ and _ math _
yeah _
i _ mean _ what E are E we E what _ are _ we _ becoming _
we _ 're _ becoming _ a _ service _ country _
as _ opposed _ to _ what _ we _ were _ twenty _ years _ ago _
yeah _
we _ were _ an _ industrial _ giant _
and _ now _ we E 're E we _ 're _ not _ going _ to _ do _ it _ because _ everybody _ is _ beating _ us _ at _ the _ game _
we _ taught _ them _ how _ to _ do _ it _
and _ they E they _ did _ it _ better _ than _ we _ do _
yeah _
simple _ as _ that _
because _ they _ have _ the _ ambition _ i _ guess _
yeah _
simple _ as _ that _
yeah _
which _ is _ good _ for _ them _
but _ on _ the _ other _ hand _ we _ kind _ of _ lose _ out _
yeah _
it _ 's _ terrible _ for _ us _
i _ think _ that _ if _ uh _ young _ people _ had _ service _ to _ the _ country _ might _ give _ them _ more _ ambition _ because _ they _ learn _ that _ serving _ other _ people _ is _ a _ good _ thing _
yeah _
yeah _
and E and _ it _ can _ be _ good _ for _ them _ too _
yeah _
oh _ yeah _
i _ mean _ even E even _ the _ greedy _ kids _ that _ we _ 've _ got _ now _
oh _ god _ you _ go _ to _ the _ mall _
and _ you _ see _ you _ know _ fourteen _ year _ old _ kids _ flaunting _ money _ because _ the _ parents _ give _ them _ money _ to _ go _ down _ and _ play _ video _ games _ all _ night _ you _ know _
i _ know _
for _ what _
i _ know _
give _ me _ the _ money _
and _ i E 'll E i _ 'll _ teach _ them _ something _ good _
well _ you _ know _ you _ know _ why _ they _ do _ it _ is _ so _ they _ can _ get _ them _ out _ of _ the _ house _
yeah _
yeah _
uh _ that _ 's _ my _ other _ complaint _
parents _ are _ n't _ parents _ any _ more _
no _
they E 've E they _ 've _ relinquished _ their _ parenting _
yeah _
one _ of _ the _ other _ subjects _ is _ do _ you _ think _ the _ public _ school _ systems _ are _ in _ trouble _
yeah _
well E as _ a _ substitute _ teacher _ for _ a _ year _ i E i _ can _ say _ yes E
yeah _
i _ mean _ i _ talked _ with _ somebody _ else _ about _ that _ another _ time _
and _ you _ know _ when _ i _ 's _ in _ graduate _ school _ working _ on _ my _ master _ 's _ degree _ in _ math _ i _ was _ uh E teaching _ as _ part E of E my E part _ of _ the _ program _
and _ i _ just _ love _ teaching _
that E was E a E lot E that _ 's _ probably _ the _ most _ fun _ i _ had _
and _ uh _ it _ helped _ me _ out _ because _ i _ learned _ things _ and _ learned _ how _ to _ do _ things _ differently _
yeah _
uh-huh _
and _ when E uh E when _ come _ time _ to _ get _ out _ of _ school _ i _ thought _ boy E i _ 'd _ like _ to _ teach _
but _ you _ know _ for E for _ what _
yeah _
you _ know _ i _ do _ n't _ want _ to _ live _ in _ a _ little _ one _ bedroom _ apartment _ the _ rest _ of _ my _ life _
exactly _
i _ mean _ that E that _ 's _ a _ sad _ thing _ to _ think _
and _ that _ 's _ kind _ of _ selfish _ on _ my _ part _
and _ i _ admit _ that _
well _ in _ a _ way _ it _ is _
but _ you _ have _ to _ look _ out _ for _ yourself _ you _ know _
yeah _
that _ 's _ right _
i _ mean _ that _ 's _
and _ when _ we _ pay _ garbage _ men _ more _ than _ we _ pay _ teachers _
that _ 's _ wrong _
yeah _
gosh _
i _ mean _
i _ 'm _ not _ saying _ that _ garbage _ men _ should _ be _ paid _ less _
i _ saying _ teachers _ should _ be _ paid _ more _
no _
i _ mean _ yeah _
they _ do _ an _ absolutely _ necessary _ job _
i _ mean _ i E i _ have _ a _ great _ deal _ of _ admiration _ for _ these _ people _ who _ can _ go _ out _ there _ and _ do _ that _
yeah _
but _ uh E i _ mean _ there E 's E there _ 's _ a _ sense _ of _ priorities _ here _ too _
yeah _
you _ know _ we _ need _
what _ 's _ more _ important _ picking _ up _ the _ garbage _ or _ educating _ our _ kids _
yeah _
they _ both _ have _ their _ place _
yeah _
they E they _
sure _
but _ you _ know _ when _ it _ gets _ right _ down _ to _ it _
i _ mean _ one _ 's _
i _ mean _ on _ the _ other _ hand _ i _ mean _ you _ take _ a _ garbage _ man _ in _ new _ york _ city _ starts _ out _ at _ twenty-six _ thousand _ dollars _
that _ 's _ pretty _ good _
well _ i _ bet _ you _ there _ 's _ a _ whole _ bunch _ of _ homeless _ people _ up _ there _ who _ would _ take _ that _ job _ for _ thirteen _ thousand _ dollars _ a _ year _
yeah _
i _ mean _ my _ other _ pet _ peeve _ is _ unions _
yeah _
oh _ yeah _
you _ know _ it E 's E just E it _ 's _ it _ 's _ ridiculous _ the _ way _ unions _ have _ gone _
there _ was _ a _ time _ when _ unions _ were _ needed _
and _ they _ served _ a _ good _ function _
and _ they _ served _ a _ good _ function _
but _ there _ are _ enough _ laws _ on _ the _ books _ now _ that _ unions _ are _ outdated _
and _ they _ 're _ only _ there _ to _ perpetuate _ their E own E their _ own _ power _ structure _
i _ remember _ the _ company _ my _ dad _ worked _ for _ the _ people _ there _ went _ on _ strike _ against _ the _ management _
it _ was _ a _ steel _ manufacturing _ place _
and _ they _ uh _
this _ was _ during _ a _ time _ when _ the _ import _ steel _ was _ so _ cheap _
and _ they _ were _ having _ a _ hard _ time _
and _ they _ told _ the _ strikers _ there _ look _
we _ need _ you _ to _ come _ back _ and _ get _ this _ stuff _ done _
or _ else _ we _ 're _ going _ to _ be _ out _ of _ business _
and _ they _ would _ n't _ come _ back _
so _ they _ went _ bankrupt _
yeah _
and E and _ they _ all _ lost _ their _ jobs _
sure _
and E and _ and _ that _ 's _ really _ what _ happened _ to _ the _ steel _ industry _ in _ this _ country _
and _ it _ 's _ like _ you _ know _
yeah _
so _ many _ times _ i _ mean _ you _ had _ the E uh E the _ coal _ miners _ and _ steel _ workers _ going _ out _ at _ the _ same _ time _
and _ well _ that _ took _ care _ of _ that _ industry _
that _ 's _ right _
and E and _ then _ and _ i _ 'll _ tell _ you _
detroit _ worked _ awfully _ hard _ on E on _ stopping _ car _ manufacturing _ in _ this _ country _
and _ they _ 're _ trying _ to _ do _ that _ now _ with _ the _ imports _
yeah _
i _ mean _ you _ know _ we _ 've _ never _ caught _ up _
and _ i _ do _ n't _ think _ we _ ever _ will _
it _ 'll _ be _ a _ tough _ road _ though _
yeah _
i _ mean _ here _ it _ is _
and _ we E 've E got E we _ 've _ got _ to _ go _ into _ partnership _ with _ the _ japanese _ to _ build _ cars _
yeah _
you _ know _ and _ they _ only _ did _ it _ because _ they E i _ guess _ they _ were _ embarrassed _ that _ they _ 're _ so _ good _ at _ it _
yeah _
that _ 's _ about _ right _
gosh _
yeah _
well _ back _ to _ the _ original _ subject _
yeah _
i _ think _ youngsters _ ought _ to _ go _ out _ and _ do _ some _ public _ service _
i _ do _ n't _ care _ what _ kind _ it _ is _
it _ teaches _ them _ pride _ in _ their _ country _
yeah _
and _ pride _ in _ themselves _ too _
that _ 's _ right _
they E could E they _ could _ i _ mean _ you _ could _ organize _ something _ just _ within _ your _ community _ same _ old _ thing _
yeah _
i _ mean _
that _ 's _ right _
that _ 's _ like _ eagle _ scouts _
sure _
uh-huh _
and _ that _ 's _ a _ great _ idea _
i _ think _ they _ ought _ to _ take _ them _ and _ i _ do _ n't _ know _ just _ have _ sort _ of _ like _ a E a _ a _ manpower _ pool _ and _ say _ okay E look _
we _ need _ somebody _
okay _
we _ 're _ going _ to _ talk _ about _ the _ public _ school _ system _ what _ 's _ wrong _ with _ it _ an E or _ if _ anything _ is _ wrong _ with _ it _ and _ what _ we _ can _ do _ about _ it _ what _ should _ be _ done _ about _ it _
okay _
fantastic _
well E one _ thing _ that _ pops _ into _ my _ mind _ real _ quick _ is _ uh E about _ the _ uh E funding _ of _ the E the _ school _ system _ right _ now _
yeah _
evidently _ uh E that E 's E that _ 's _ a _ big _ problem _
yeah _
it _ 's _ amazing _ uh _
i _ always _ thought _ that _ teachers _ never _ got _ paid _ nearly _ enough _ i _ mean _ to _ be _ doing _ what _ they _ 're _ doing _ uh _
right _
when _ i _ was _ in _ college _ i E i _ enjoyed _ teaching _
'cause _ i _ did _ some _ teaching _ part-time _
and _ i _ really _ enjoyed _ that _
but _ i _ would _ n't _ want _ to _ go _ teach _ high _ school _ or _ junior _ high _
it _ just _ you _ know _ all _ the _ problems _
oh _ lord _ i _ mean _ yeah _
an _ you _ talk _ about _ stress _ and _ pressure _
i _ tell _ you _ what _
it _ 's _ uh _
yeah _
they _ 're _ putting _ in _ fifty _ sixty _ hours _ a _ week _
i _ 'm _ sure _ because _ they _ 've _ got _ to _ grade _ papers _ and _ get _ class _ stuff _ ready _
do _
right _
and E you _ know _ and _ they _ 're _ being _ paid _ probably _ half _ what _ most _ people _ being _ paid _
exactly _
and _
and _ we _ 're _ paying _ basketball _ people _ you _ know _ millions _ of _ dollars _ a _ year _ for E for _ what _ you _ know _
that _ 's _ right _
and _ then _ they _ uh _ poof _ it _ off _ you _ know _ do _ like _ tarpley _
yeah _
but _ uh _ i _
what _ gets _ me _ is _ i _ ca _ n't _ believe _ that _ congress E uh E or _ our _ state _ legislature _ ca _ n't _ come _ up _ with _ uh E some _ kind _ of _ workable _ means _ to _ have _ funds _ for _ the _ school _
you _ know _ it _ 's _ uh _
i _ just _ do _ n't _ understand _ that _
yeah _
it _ 's _ uh _
now _ do _ you _ have _ little _ kids _ or _ what _
no _ uh _
sure _ do _ n't _
my _ wife _ and _ i _ 've _ just _ been _ married _ about _ two _ years _
but _ i _ have _ a _ sister _ that _ 's _ a _ uh _ school _ teacher _
and _ uh _
yeah _
yeah _
my _ wife _ and _ i _ have _ a E a _ three _ year _ old _ almost _ four _ and _ a E a _ two _ year _ old _
okay _
so _ we _ 're _ looking _ at _ the E the _ older _ one _ going _ to _ school _ next _ year _ not E not _ well E not _ this _ coming _ fall _ but _ the _ year _ after _ that _
okay _
so _ it _ 's _ getting _ close _
yeah _
he _ 's _ going _ to _ be _ going _ to _ kindergarten _
so _
right _
so _ you _ know _ we E 're E we _ 're _ thinking _ about _ that _
what _ 's _ that _ going _ to _ be _ like _
are _ they _ going _ to _ be _ taught _ nothing _
or _ they _ going _ be _ taught _ something _
we E 're E going E to E we _ 're _ going _ to _ be _ involved _ in _ our _ child _ 's _ education _
we _ 're _ going _ to _ be _ teaching _ him _ what _ we _ can _ at _ home _ of _ course _ because _ uh _ i _ guess _ we _ do _ n't _ trust _ the _ school _ system _ which _ is _ very _ sad _ uh _
right _
but E but _ if _ it _ does _ n't _ start _ at _ home _ it _ 's _ not _ going _ to _ go _ anywhere _ you _ know _
exactly _
right _
that _ 's _ true _
and _ we _ 're _ going _ to _ try _ to _ teach _ him _ good _ values _ because _ you _ know _ when E when _ they _ get _ to _ upper _ level _ school _ and _ they _ start _ teaching _ them _ well E hey E if _ you _ can _ play _ football _ or _ basketball _ that _ 's _ what _ 's _ important _ not _ if _ you _ can _ read _ or _ write _ or _ do _ or _ understand _ some _ science _ you _ know _
exactly _
i _ mean _ give _ me _ a _ break _
that E 's E that _ 's _ that _ 's _ bogus _
right _
right _
well E and _ uh E you _ know _ one _ thing _ my _ wife _ and _ i _ 've _ talked _ about _ are _ uh E private _ schools _ you _ know _ whether _ uh E uh E we _ would _ want _ to _ invest _ in E in _ private _ schools _ as _ they _ 're _ growing _ up _ because _ you _ know _ just _ in _ the _ dallas _ area _ um E we _ 're _ not _ real _ comfortable _ with E the E with _ the _ public _ schools _
yeah _
and _ dallas _ uh _ school _ district _ just _ recently _ got _ an _ advised _ status _ because _ of _ their _ low _ quality _ schooling _
right _
i _ could _ n't _ believe _ that _
right _
you _ know _ one E that _ 's _ one _ reason _ we _ bought _ a _ house _ here _ in _ plano _
we _ were _ hoping _ you _ know _ well _ the _ school _ district _ 's _ going _ to _ be _ good _ you _ know _ for _ resale _ value _ and _ so _ on _ and _ so _ forth _
yeah _
but _ uh _ i _ can _ definitely _ uh _ see _ on _ down _ the _ road _ you _ know _ where _ we _ do _ have _ kids _ and _ are _ getting _ to _ that _ age _ that _ 's _ going _ to _ be _ a _ definite _ concern _
yeah _
we E talked E you _ talked _ about E before _ about _ the _ school _ funding _
i _ think _ there _ 's _ only _ going _ to _ be _ one _ solution _ to _ school _ funding _ which _ i _ do _ n't _ think _ will _ be _ necessarily _ the _ best _ way _
but _ i _ think _ what _ 's _ going _ to _ have _ to _ happen _ is _ there _ 's _ going _ to _ have _ to _ be _ tuition _ for _ grade _ school _ and _ junior _ high _ and _ high _ school _ kids _
that _ 's _ the _ only _ way _ they _ 're _ going _ to _ fund _ it _ because _ if _ they _ start _ raising _ taxes _ for _ property _ and E people _ are _ going _ to _ throw _ a _ fit _
that _ 's _
yeah _
and _ you _ know _ that _ 's _
taxes _ right _ now _ are _ political _ suicide _ you _ know _
oh _ yeah _
and _ i _ do _ n't _ think _ any _ politician _ 's _ going _ to _ do _ that _
so _
yeah _
and _ the _ only _ thing _ they E they _ would _ think _ of _ would _ be _ tuition _ you _ know _
if _ it _ works _ at _ colleges _ it _ will _ work _ down _ below _
right _
and _ you _ know _ that E 's E going E to E that _ 's _ going _ to _ affect _ the _ people _ that _ are _ having _ kids _ in _ school _ of _ course _ which _ is _ probably _ the _ only _ fair _ thing _ to _ do _
but _ it _ will _ be _ hard _ for _ those _ that _ people _ that _ have E have _ in _ school _ because _ they _ have _ to _ pay _ out _ even _ more _
exactly _
and _ you _ know _ it _ 's _ going _ to _ really _ hurt _ the E the _ middle _ class _ uh E people _ i _ think _ because _ uh E they _ 're _ the _ ones _ that _ will _ probably _ have _ to E to _ carry _ the _ brunt _ of _ the _ load _
oh _ yeah _
that _ 's _ right _
so _ uh _
and _ most _ of _ the _ problems _ with _ kids _ in _ school _ carrying _ guns _ and E and _ knives _ and _ everything _
i _ mean _ good _ grief _ what _ 's _
yeah _
now E that E 's E that _ 's _ just _ unbelievable _ to _ me _ you _ know _
i _ ca _ n't _ believe _ that _
i _ mean _ when _ i _ was _ in _ junior _ high _ and _ high _ school _ that _ never _ happened _
you _ never _ heard _ about _ that _
well _ yeah _
we E did E n't E we _ did _ n't _ even _ think _ about _ it _ you _ know _
no _
and _ now _ you _ know _ what _ do _ we _ have _ now _
you _ know _ got _ kids _ that _ either _ got _ a E you _ know _ a _ magnum _ gun _ school _
like _ good _ grief _
right _
i _ mean _ i E 'd E i _ 'd _ be _ afraid _ to _ be _ in _ school _ i _ mean _ teaching _ or _ even _ being _ a _ student _
and _ think _ what E what _ 's _ it _ going _ to _ be _ like _ for _ my E my _ youngest _ an E my _ oldest _ son _ when _ he _ goes _ to _ school _
what _ 's _ going _ to _ happen _
i _ mean _ i E i _ 'm _ afraid _ for _ him _ to _ go _
exactly _
right _
but _ there _ again _ you _ ca _ n't _ hold _ them _ back _
another _ reason _
and _ you _ want _ to _ encourage _ them _ you _ know _ to E to _ be _ active _ and _ everything _ in _ school _
but _ uh E you _ know _ with _ all _ the _ peer _ pressure _ that _ 's _ going _ on _ with _ all _ the _ negative _ things _ it E is E uh E it _ 's _ a _ tough _ environment _ to _ be _ growing _ up _ in _
yeah _
and _ lot _ tougher _ than _ it _ was _ when _ i _ was _ going _ to _ school _
and _ that _ was _
well E i E was E i _ graduated _ high _ school _ in _ nineteen _ seventy-nine _
so _
okay _
that _ was _ what _ twelve _ years _ ago _ i _ guess _
right _
so _ you _ know _ it _ 's _ lot _ different _ now _
and _ what _ 's _ it _ going _ to _ be _ like _ in _ another _ twelve _ years _ when _ my _ uh _ oldest _ son _ is _ in _ high _ school _
that _ 's _ right _
that _ 's _ right _
i E 'm E afraid E to E i _ 'm _ afraid _ to _ even _ think _ about _ it _
that E yeah E that _ is _ a _ scary _ thought _
but _ uh _ i _ do _ n't _ know _
i E i _ guess _ what _ you _ have _ to _ do _ is _ just _ uh E keep _ in E uh E you _ know _ encouraging _ them _ and E and _ uh E uh E try _ to _ be _ open _ with _ them _ so _ that _ you _ can _ deal _ with _ the _ problems _ as _ they _ come _ up _
that _ 's _ all _ you _ can _ do _
yeah _
and _
you E got E to E you _ got _ to _ be _ your _ child _ 's _ best _ friend _ i _ guess _ even _ when _ they _ 're _ a _ teenager _ and _ they _ you _ know _ are _ kind _ of _ standoffish _
right _
still _ you _ got _ to _ be _ their _ best _ friend _ because _ when _ they _ 've _ got _ problems _ who _ they _ going _ to _ go _ to _ their _ friends _ that _ are _ dealing _ drugs _ or E or _ your _ parents _ you _ know _
exactly _
an E and _ if _ they _ go _ to _ their _ friends _ dealing _ drugs _ they _ 're _ going _ to _ be _ in _ even _ worse _ shape _
that _ 's _ right _
and E and _ the _ schools _ do E n't E do _ n't _ really _ encourage _ to _ stay _ away _ from _ that _ you _ know _
the _ schools _ are _ there _ to _ teach _ history _ and _ that _ we _ fought _ the _ civil _ war _ etcetera _ etcetera _
they _ do _ n't _ teach _ them _ good _ values _ like _ drugs _ are _ bad _
i E maybe _ i _ 'm _ wrong _ because _ i _ have _ n't _ you _ know _ been _ in _ that _ kind _ of _ environment _ for _ a _ long _ time _
but _ it _ just _ is _ amazing _ you _ know _
right _
need _ to _ teach _ them _ good _ values _
that _ 's _ true _
that _ 's _ true _
and _ uh _
of _ course _ if _ i _ say _ this _ is _ a _ good _ value _ someone _ else _ is _ going _ to _ stand _ up _ and _ say _ oh _ no _
and _ the _ a _ c _ l _ u _ is _ going _ to _ get _ after _ them _ and _ have _ a _ lawsuit _ which _ is _ going _ to _ take _ twenty _ years _ to _ resolve _ you _ know _
right _
well _ and _ i _ think _ uh _ you _ touched _ on _ it _ you _ know _
you _ 've _ got _ to _ start _ them _ at _ the _ home _ you _ know _
yeah _
that E 's E where E they E that _ 's _ where _ they _ get _ the E the _ deep _ rooted _ values _
and E and _ and _ uh E and _ that _ 's _ about _ right _
that _ 's _ all _ you _ can _ do _
then _ you _ just _ have _ to _ hope _ and _ pray _ that E that _ everything _ uh E works E out E works _ out _ okay _
so _
that _ 's _ right _
well _ i _ got _ to _ be _ going _
so _ uh _
okay _
well _ hey _ i _ appreciate _ the _ call _
nice _ talking _ to _ you _ today _
you _ to _
have _ a _ good _ life _ uh _
hi _ wanet _ is _ his _ last _
how _ are _ you _
i _ 'm _ doing _ fine _
where _ you _ from _
i _ 'm _ from _ new _ england _
massachusetts _
okay _
i _ 'm _ from _ berkeley _ california _
wow _
this _ is _ quite E a E quite _ a _ long _ distance _
yeah _
it _ certainly _ is _
do _ you _ have _ any _ pets _
no _
use _ too _
use _ to _
but _ none E none _ right _ now _
how _ come _ uh _ you _ do _ n't _ have _ any _ now _
you _ get _ tired _ of _ them _
well E i E i _ live _ in _ an _ apartment _ building _
and E and _ uh E and _ and _ it E it _ it _ 's _ just _ not _ feasible _ you _ know _
yeah _
i _ 'd _ love _ to _ have _ a _ dog _ you _ know _
i _ 've _ got _ a _ little _ doggy _ uh E that _ i _ 've _ had _ quite E uh E quite _ a _ long _ time _
in _ fact _ she _ just _ turned _ sixteen _ years _ old _ new _ year _ 's _ eve _
ah _
and _ uh _
is _ she _
i _ beg _ your _ pardon _
what _ is _ she _
she _ 's _ uh _ uh _ uh _ a _ poodle _
uh E a E toy E poodle E a _ toy _ poodle _
and _ she _ 's _
ah _
ah _
my E i _ got _ my _ mom _ a _ teacup _ little _ mutt _ not _ too _ long _ ago _
this _ is _ a _ little _ bigger _ than _ a _ teacup _
yeah _
and _ uh E it _ 's _ funny _ how E uh E how _ i E i _ uh E acquired _ this _ animal _
uh _ when _ i _ was _ uh _ married _ my _ uh _ ex-wife _ had _ said _ that _ she _ had _ a _ friend _ who _ had _ a _ little _ puppy _ that _ she _ needed _
uh _ the _ woman _ needed _ someone _ to _ baby-sit _
and _ uh _ this _ is _ what _ she _ had _ told _ the _ kids _
and _ she _ even _ told _ me _ that _
and _ after _ the _ two _ week _ period _ was _ up _ uh _ she _ then _ informed _ me _ that _ the _ woman _ no _ longer _ wanted _ the _ little _ puppy _ and _ wanted _ to _ know _ if _ we _ wanted _ to _ keep _ it _
well E after _ you _ had _ an _ animal _ for _ a _ couple _ of _ weeks _ it E 's E uh E you E become E you _ become _ attached _ to _ it _
oh _ for _ sure _
oh _ yeah _
so _ i _ 've _ had _ this _ dog _ now _ for E for _ sixteen _ years _
and _ she _ 's _ been _ a _ lot _ of _ company _
uh _ she _ 's _ uh _ however _ getting _ a _ little _ old _
and _ things _ are _ starting _ to _ fail _
uh E i E i _ live _ alone _ now _
and _ she _ stays _ in _ the _ house _ all _ day _ while _ i _ go _ to _ work _
and _ uh E she _ 's _ been _ holding _ herself _ pretty _ well _ the E uh E up _ until _ you _ know _ recently _ where _ she _ 's _ been _ having _ accidents _ in _ the _ house _ because _ she _ either _ is _ losing _ control _ or _ she _ forgets _ where _ she _ is _
and _ uh _ i _ find _ a _ little _ present _ on _ the _ floor _ sometimes _ when _ i _ come _ home _
but _ she E 's E she _ 's _ usually _ pretty _ good _
yes _
well E my E my _ mother _ has _ one _ that _ 's _ uh E
it E 's E uh E it _ 's _ uh _ teacup _
and _ uh _ it _ 's _ made _ such _ a _ difference _ for _ her _
but _ you _ know _ just _ i _ you _ know _
the _ way _ my _ mom _ 's _ presence _ countenance _ is _ just E just _ for _ having _ a _ puppy _
but _ you _ know _ having _ this _ dog _
she _ 's _ had _ it _ for _ i _ guess _ three _ years _ now _ oh _ possibly _ four _
uh-huh _
but _ uh E it E was E it _ it _ 's _ it _ 's _ really _ made _ such _ a _ difference _ for _ her _
i _ really _ would _ like _ to _ uh _
i _ 'm _ a _ disabled _ person _
uh-huh _
so _ i _ 'm _ unable _ to E to _ really _ take _ care _ of _ a _ pet _
and _ if _ that _ were _ n't _ so _ i _ would _ certainly _ have _ one _
i E just E i _ just _
it _ frustrates _ me _ sometimes _ not _ being _ able _ to _ have _ a _ dog _
yeah _
huh _ well _ you _ might _ want _ to _ get _ yourself _ uh _ an _ animal _ that _ does _ n't _ require _ much _ attention _ like _ a _ cat _
oh _ yeah _
well _ yeah _
uh E i E i _ i _ typically _ am _ not _ a _ cat _ person _
i _ have _ a _ friend _ that _ uh E has _ on _ occasion _ uh E brought _ her _ cat _ over _ for _ me _ to _ keep _ for E you _ know _ from _ time _ to _ time _
and _ this _ cat _ is _ like _ no _ other _ cat _ i _ have _ ever _ seen _
and _ uh _ it _ would _ sleep _ on _ my _ chest _ you _ know _
yeah _
it E 's E just E it _ 's _ just _ a _ great _ cat _
but _
well E my E my _ personal _ preference _ is E is _ a _ dog _
uh E i _ do _ n't _ know _ that E uh E that _ i _ would _ ever _ want _ a _ cat _
oh _ i _ like _ cats _
i _ just _ would _ n't _ want _ to _ own _ one _
uh E they E 're E not E uh E they _ 're _ they _ 're _ affectionate _
well _ you _ do _ n't _ own _ cats _
but _ they _
yeah _
i _ do _ n't _ know _
i _ ca _ n't _ seem _ to _ communicate _ with _ a _ cat _ like _ i _ can _ with _ my _ dog _
yeah _
you E they _ they _ own _ you _ or E or _ you _ know _ grant _ you _ with _ you E their _ presence _ you _ know _
yeah _
right _
yeah _
right _
that _
yes _
we _ 're _ supposed _ to _ appreciate _ them _
well E my E my _ dog _ when E i E came E home E uh E when _ i _ come _ home _ in _ the _ evenings _ my _ dog _ greets _ me _ at _ the _ door _
i _ do _ n't _ know _ that _ a _ cat _ would _ do _ that _ uh _
yeah _
i _ used _ to _ have _ a _ cat _ that _ could _ read _ me _ better _ than _ any _ human _ being _ in _ my _ life _
yeah _
i _ could _ just _ walk _ in _ the _ door _
and _ she _ knew _ whether _ to E to _ to _ quietly _ come _ up _ to _ me _ or _ to _ just _ run _ and _ knock _ me _ over _
i _ mean _ she _ really _ could _ pick _ up _ on _ my _ mood _ uh _ the _ way _ i _ walked _ in _ the _ door _
yeah _
yeah _
it _ was _ uh _ uncanny _ like _ a _
huh E i E i _ think _ uh E in _ a _ way _ we _ 're _ able _ to _ read _ each _ other _ pretty _ well _ because _ uh E she _ knows _ when _ i _ 'm _ upset _ and _ i _ know _ when _ she _ 's _ not _ feeling _ good _ too _
so _
yeah _
i _ know _ like _ when _ she _ has _ an _ accident _ i _ know _ she _ 's _ not _ doing _ it _ on _ purpose _
when E when _ she _ was _ younger _ she _ used _ to _ do _ that _ to _ get _ even _ with _ me _
yeah _
uh E and E and _ you _ know _ some _ people _ might _ not _ believe _ that _
but E but _ but _ uh E i _ do _
sure _
oh _ absolutely _
like E if E i E if _ i _ put _ her _ in _ a _ room _ all _ by _ herself _ and _ close _ the _ door _ and _ leave _ her _ there _ for _ a _ few _ hours _ uh E because _ i _ was _ going _ out _ she _ would _ uh E break _ something _ or _ rip _ up _ the _ carpet _ or _ do _ something _ just _ to E uh E to _ to _ let _ me _ know _ that _ she _ was _ unhappy _ with _ what _ i _ did _
really _
yeah _
that _ 's _ the _ way _
well _ i _ had _ that _ cat _ that _ i _ mentioned _ alfie _
one _ morning _ you _ know _ the _ first _ thing _ you _ do _ is _ you _ get _ up _ and _ you E you _ you _ feed _ this _ cat _ something _ and E and _ you _ make _ sure _ that _ it _ can _ get _ to _ its _ litter _ box _
well _ for _ some _ reason _ during _ the _ night _ the _ door _ was _ not _ quite _ wide _ enough _ for _ it _ to _ get _ through _
uh-huh _
and _ uh E the _ next _ morning _ uh E when _ my _ roommate _ got _ up _ and E and _ uh E did _ not _ feed _ it _ right _ away _ it _ decided _ that E that _ it _ was _ going _ to _ protest _
and _ so _ it _ jumped _ up _ on _ my _ bed _ and _ anointed _ my _ blanket _ for _ me _ looking E looking _ at _ me _ eye _ to _ eye _ all _ the _ time _ while _ it _ was _ doing _ it _
all _ right _ have _ i _ got _ your _ attention _ now _
oh _ yes _
animals _ have _ a _ way _ of _ talking _
alfie _ did _
i _ tell _ you _ if _ i _ could _ have _ gotten _ a _ hold _ of _ that _ cat _ that _ day _
i E i _ do _ n't _ know _ that E i E 'd E uh E that _ i _ 'd _ trade _ my _ dog _ in _ for _ the _ world _
uh _ it _ was _ about _ two _ years _ ago _ she _ got _ sick _ on _ me _
and _ i _ took _ her _ to E the E uh E to _ the _ vet _ 's _ because _ she _ was _ n't _ eating _ and E and _ uh E she _ was _ n't _ able _ to _ jump _
she _ you _ know _ lost _ all _ her _ activity _
and _ uh _ she _ stayed _ there _ for _ one _ day _
and _ the _ doctor _ called _ me _ up _ and _ said _ uh E she _ had _ a _ low _ white _ cell _ count _ and _ that _ uh E she E was E n't E she _ was _ dying _ and _ uh E suggested _ that _ i _ take _ her _ to _ a _ working E dog E hospital E animal _ hospital _
so _ i _ took _ his _ suggestion _
and _ i _ uh E took _ the E the _ dog _ to _ a E hospital E the _ dog _ hospital _ there _
and _ they _ said _ they _ 'd _ keep _ her _ there _ for _ three _ days _
well _ she _ ended _ staying _ there _ five _ days _ at _ a _ hundred _ and _ something _ dollars _ a _ day _ because _ she _ was _ in _ intensive _ care _
it _ cost _ me _ over _ five _ hundred _ dollars _
ouch _
plus _ the E the _ uh E the _ vet _ sent _ me _ a _ bill _ for _ what _ he _ did _
and E uh E then _ she _ recouped _
she _ was _ okay _ for _ a _ couple _ of _ years _
and _ then _ she _ got _ sick _ on _ me _ again _
and _ i _ brought _ her _ to _ a _ different _ vet _ this _ time _
and _ i _ told _ the _ vet _ what _ medication _ i _ had _ given _ her _ and _ everything _
and _ uh E he _ gave _ me _ the E medication E the _ same _ medication _ that _ i _ gave _ her _ the _ last _ time _
and _ she _ was _ okay _
and _ she _ 's _ been _ okay _ every _ since _
it _ 's _ been _ about _ two _ years _ now _
huh _ well _ that _ 's _ great _
it _ really _ is _
i E i _ 'm _ glad _ that _ she _ was _ able _ to _ pull _ out _ of _ it _ that _ way _ and _ so _ cheaply _ the _ second _ time _
yeah _
well E the E see E the _ problem _ is _ if E if _ the _ if _ someone _ would _ have _ came _ up _ to _ me _ and _ said _ it _ 's _ going _ to _ cost _ you _ five _ hundred _ dollars _ to _ keep _ your _ dog _ alive _
what _ do _ you _ want _ to _ do _
i _ probably _ would _ have _ had _ second _ thoughts _
yeah _
of _ course _ you _ would _
but _ what E they E well E what _ they _ do _ is E is _ they _ say _ well E it _ 's _ going _ to _ cost _ you _ know _ twenty _ dollars _ for _ tests _ and _ forty _ dollars _ for _ this _
and E and _ you _ know _ and _ it _ creeps _ up _ on _ you _
you _ do _ n't _ know _ that _ uh _ you _ know _
you E really E you _ do _ n't _ know _ what _ it _ 's _ going _ to _ until _ it _ 's _ all _ over _
uh E to _ give _ you _ an _ example _ my _ mom _ had _ an _ elderly _ cat _ who E uh E whoever _ evidently _ got _ a _ hold _ of _ it _
and _ uh _ the _ cat _ got _ sick _
so _ she _ took _ the _ cat _ to _ the _ vet _
and _ she _ had _ the _ cat _ there _ for _ two _ days _
and _ then _ the _ cat _ died _
so _ the _ doctor _ had _ called _ her _ up _ and _ said _ uh _ your _ cat _ died _
and _ you _ owe _ me _ this _ bill _
and _ oh E by _ the _ way _ do _ you _ want _ me _ to E to _ bury _ the _ cat _
so _ it _ cost _ her _ three _ hundred _ dollars _ uh _
and _ she _ did _ n't _ get _ the _ cat _ back _
so _ yeah _
they _ had _ to _ pay _ for _ all _ the _ medical _ uh _ bills _ that _ the _ cat _ ran _ up _ plus _ the _ burial _ expenses _
and _ uh _ you _ know _ she _ just _ brought _ the _ cat _ in _ because _ he _ was _ n't _ feeling _ good _
so _ that E that _ was _ kind _ of _ a _ surprise _
really _
geez _
at _
yeah _
you _ kind _ of _ wonder _ what _ really _ happened _
yeah _
well _ even _ the _ you _ know _
they E they _ claimed _ they _ did _ the _ best _ that _ they _ could _ have E have _
and _ then _ the _ cat _ uh _ died _
so _
my _ goodness _
i E 'm E i _ 'm _ looking _ for _ another _ cat _ for _ them _ uh E
i E i _ 've _ i _ 've _ got _ a _ little _ kitten _ uh E that _ 's _ still _ uh E just _ being _ born _ right _ now _
so _ another _ five _ or _ six _ weeks _ i _ 'll _ be _ bringing _ the _ little _ kitten _ over _ to E uh E to _ my _ folks _
well E that E that _ that _ that _ will _ make _ their _ day _
yeah _
i E i _ think _ it _ will _
because _ they _ 're _ both _ in E their E in _ their _ seventies _ and _ uh E the _ cat _ uh E although _ it _ 's _ a _ little _ bit _ of _ work _ for _ them _ sometimes _ it E turns E it _ turns _ out _ to _ be _ uh E uh E a _ pleasant _ experience _ for _ them _
uh _ i _ think _ they _ enjoy _ that _
only _ work _ initially _
yeah _
for _ cats _ anyway _ you _ know _
yeah _
well _ listen _
it _ 's _ been _ a _ pleasure _ talking _ to _ you _
well _ the _ same _ here _
and _ you _ take _ care _
okay _
bye _ now _
maybe _ we _ 'll _ talk _ again _ sometimes _
okay _
what _ is _ that _ sound _
that _ 's _ my _ buzzer _ at _ the _ door _
oh _ okay _
i _ 'll _ let _ you _ go _
okay _
right _
thank _ you _
uh _ so _ what _ do _ you _ do _ to _ exercise _
uh _
i _ uh _ weight _ train _ uh _ three _ days _ on _ and _ one _ day _ off _
uh-huh _
i _ uh _ ride _ bicycles _ uh _ fifteen _ twenty _ miles _ i _ do _ n't _ know _ maybe _ three _ times _ maybe _ four _ times _ a _ week _
i _ play _ basketball _ uh _ couple _ times _ a _ week _
i _ play _ softball _ one _ night _ a _ week _
uh _ that _ 's _ what _ i _ do _
um _
what _ about _ yourself _
that _ 's _ pretty _ impressive _
uh _ i _ guess _ i _ bicycle _
uh _ the _ amount _ varies _
as _ much _ as _ a _ hundred _ and _ fifty _ miles _ a _ week _
uh-huh _
uh _ i _ guess _ a _ play _ softball _ one _ night _ a _ week _
and _ i _ backpack _ a _ lot _ over _ the _ summer _
oh _ really _
yeah _
that E 's E that _ 's _ about _ the _ extent _ of _ it _
i _ mean _ i _ do _ n't _ do _ any _ of _ those _ things _ particularly _ you _ know _ for _ exercise _
but _ uh _ i _ guess _ the _ bicycling _ is _ the _ one _ thing _ i _ 'll _ sort _ of _ like _ do _ if _ i _ feel _ like _ i _ need _ to _ go _ exercise _
uh _ but _ i _ do _ it _ mostly _ for _ fun _
yeah _
uh _ what _ do _ you _ ride _ uh _ like _ a _ bunch _ of _ hills _ or _ pretty _ flat _
it E it _ it _ varies _
uh _ out _ near _ my _ house _ is _ pretty _ hilly _
uh _ but _ sometimes _ i _ bike _ to _ work _ which _ is _ about _ uh _ a _ fifteen _ mile _ trip _ each _ way _
and _ that _ 's _ mostly _ flat _
how _ long _ does _ that _ take _ you _ to _ get _ to _ work _
uh _ about _ forty-five _ fifty _ minutes _
how E how _ does _ that _ work E work _ out _ with _ uh E storing _ your _ bike _ and _ showering _ and _ all _ that _
yeah _
it _ can _ be _ a _ pain _
uh _ basically _ uh _ i _ work _ on _ a _ campus _
so _ i _ can _ store _ my _ bike _ in _ my _ office _ and _ walk _ across _ the _ uh _ campus _ to _ the _ uh _ gym _ use _ the _ shower _ there _
uh-huh _
uh E but _ it E 's E it _ 's _ enough _ of _ a _ pain _ that _ i _ did _ it _ consistently _ one _ year _
i _ would _ commute _ every _ day _ uh _
but _ it _ just _ became _ such _ a _ pain _
i _ mean _ we _ 're _ talking _ you _ know _ forty-five _ fifty _ minutes _ for _ biking _ uh _ and _ sometimes _ longer _ if _ you _ had _ adverse _ wind _ and _ then _ another _ half _ an _ hour _ you _ know _ to _ cool _ down _ and _ take _ a _ shower _ and _ all _ this _ kind _ of _ stuff _
right _
it _ was _ a _ big _ hunk E hunk _ of _ the _ day _
uh _ and _ then _ of _ course _ another _ hour _ to _ get _ back _ home _
uh E so _ i _ 've _ been _ doing _ that _ less _ and E and _ concentrating _ more _ on _ you _ know _ light _ biking _ when _ i _ get _ home _ on _ the _ evening _ and _ then _ you _ know _ some _ more _ on _ the _ weekends _
yeah _
do _ you _ ride _ a _ lot _ of _ rallies _ or _ a _ lot _ of _ those _ around _ there _
not _ so _ much _
uh _ i _ guess _ mostly _ i _ bike _ on _ my _ own _
i _ 've _ got _ a _ touring _ bike _ uh _ though _ i _ have _ n't _ gone _ on _ any _ extended _ trips _ with _ it _
uh-huh _
how _ about _ you _
what _ kind _ of _ biking _ do _ you _ do _
uh _ well _ actually _ my _ wife _ just _ got _ me _ into _ it _
and _ i _ did E an E did _ an _ internship _ at _ the _ institute _ for _ aerobics _ research _ in _ dallas _ the _ cooper _ clinic _
uh-huh _
and _ i _ learned _ all _ the _ health _ benefits _ of _ you _ know _
i _ was _ a _ solid _ weight _ trainer _
uh-huh _
and _ all _ i _ did _ was _ weights _ and _ aerobic _ exercise _
and _ then _ my _ wife _ got _ me _ into _ the _ aerobic _ exercise _ and _ said _ you _ really _ need _ to _ do _ it _
so _ once _ i _ got _ into _ this _ uh _ internship _ i _ learned _ all _ the _ physiological _ advantages _ to _ it _
uh-huh _
so _ i _ began _ a _ program _ couple _ i _ do _ n't _ know _ probably _ three _ or _ four _ weeks _ ago _
and _ i _ did _ my _ first _ bike _ rally _ this _ saturday _
i _ did _ uh E forty E forty _ miles _
um _
and _ uh _ that _ 's _ the _ longest _ i _ 've _ ever _ ridden _ so _ far _
i _ usually _ you _ know _ fifteen _ or _ twenty _
uh-huh _
and _ it E was E it _ was _ kind _ of _ hilly _
and _ it _ was _ pretty _ tough _
but _ uh _ i _ 'm _ looking _ at _ uh _ doing _ a _ lot _ more _ of _ it _ because _ you _ know _ my _ wife _ is _ really _ into _ it _
oh _ i _ see _
and _ i E i _ kind _ of _ held _ her _ back _ a _ little _ bit _ this E this _ weekend _
she _ wanted _ to _ go _ go _ go _
but _ you _ know _ she _ wanted _ to _ stay _ with _ me _
uh-huh _
it _ 's _ good _ to _ have _ a _ partner _
yeah _
it _ really _ is _
are _ you _ think _ of _ doing _ any _ like _ centuries _ or _
yeah _
that _ would _ be _ cool _ sometime _ if _ i _ could _ you _ know _ work _ up _ to _ that _
uh-huh _
yeah _
i _ just _ wondered _ if _ you _ were _ going _ to _ do _ that _ mostly _ or _ more _ like _ you _ know _ uh _ uh _ touring _ like _ from _ vermont _ or _ you _ know _ that _ kind _ of _ thing _
oh _
i _ mean _ people _ seem _ to _ get _ into _ different _ aspects _
one _ is _ more _ of _ a _ distance _
and _ one _ 's _ more _ just _ you _ know _
they _ want _ to _ put _ some _ equipment _ on _ their _ bike _ and _ go _ for _ a _ tour _
i _ 've _ never _ really _ looked _ into _ that _
that E you _ know _ that _ 's _
my _ wife _ would _ just _ love _ that _
uh-huh _
and _ i _ may _ do _ that _ sometime _
there _ again _ i _ 'm _ just _ kind _ of _ a _ fledgling _ into _ this _
uh-huh _
i E 've E it _ 's _ kind _ of _ funny _
i _ called _ this _ number _
and _ i _ was _ just _ reading _ through _ a _ bicycle _ magazine _ and _ going _ through _ all _ the _ different _ tours _ coming _ up _
yeah _
yeah _
i _ mean _ around _ texas _ you E you _ got _ about _ five _ or _ six _
if _ you _ live _ around _ the _ dallas _ area _ you _ got _ five _ or _ six _ every _ weekend _ to _ choose _ from _ because _ they _ 're _ really _ into _ it _
oh _ that _ 's _ nice _
um _
bicycling _ is _ really _ big _ here _
i _ did _ n't _ know _ that _ and E you _ know _ until _ i _ came _ down _ here _ and _ kind _ of _ caught _ the _ fever _
wow _
yeah _
because _ i _ lived _ in _ indiana _ all _ my _ life _
and _ you _ know _ you _ may _ say _ see _ one _ or _ two _ guys _ on _ a _ bicycle _ that _ or _ above _ the _ age _ of _ fifteen _ or _ something _
uh-huh _
but _ other _ than _ that _ it _ 's _ nothing _ up _ there _ like _ it _ is _ down _ here _
yeah _
i _ 'm _ not _ sure _ why _ that _ is _
i _ mean _ generally _ in _ the _ midwest _ it _ seems _ to _ be _ less _ much _ less _
i _ mean _ maybe _ it _ 's _ because _ of _ the _ winters _ uh E or _ maybe _ just _ because _ you _ know _ there E 's E there _ 's _ a _ lot _ more _ flat _ lands _ you _ know _ out _ in _ the _ west _
probably _
yeah _
so _ it _ makes _ biking _ a _ better _ alternative _ for _ transportation _
yeah _
it E there _ 's _ a _ lot _ of _ bikers _ around _ here _
it E 's E it _ 's _ really _ neat _
uh-huh _
there _ are _ a E lot E of E a _ lot _ of _ resources _ a _ lot _ of _ magazines _ and _ stuff _
little _ texas _ bicyclist _ is _ like _ a _ little _ newspaper _ that _ comes _ out _ every _ month _
um _
it _ 's _ free _
just _ go _ to _ the _ bike E shock E bike _ shop _ and _ pick _ it _ up _
and _ it _ 's _ got _ all _ the _ rides _ coming _ up _
so _ i _ guess _ i _ 'm _ going _ to _ be _ busy _ about _ every _ saturday _ this _ summer _ going _ to _ a _ different _ ride _
oh _ that _ 's _ terrific _
yeah _
see _ a _ little _ bit _ of _ texas _ i _ 've _ never _ seen _ before _
uh-huh _
so _ uh _ how _ long _ have _ you _ been _ biking _
oh _ i _ guess _ as _ an _ adult _ for _ just _ about _ the _ past _ uh _ three _ years _ or _ so _
uh _ you _ know _ i _ guess _ last _ time _ i _ did _ it _ before _ that _ was _ college _ which _ was _ about _ ten _ years _ ago _
yeah _
and _ uh _ yeah _
i _ guess _ i _ just _ never _ really _ thought _ about _ it _ much _ for _ a _ while _ uh _ until _ i _ suddenly _ discovered _ all _ my _ friends _ were _ basically _ biking _ a _ lot _
and _ so _ i _ thought _ i _ 'd _ try _ it _ too _
have _ you E ever E had E a E uh E it _ 's _ kind _ of _ slightly _ off _ the _ subject _ but _ you _ ever _ had _ a E uh E a _ blood _ workup _ done _ recently _ or _ since _ you _ 've _ been _ biking _ to _ see _ if _ it _
no _
i _ have _ n't _
no _
because _ it E really E from _ what _ i _ understand _ it _ really _ improves _ your _ uh E cholesterol _
um _
and _ you _ know _ it E uh E it _ kind _ of _ knocks _ down _ two _ of _ the _ big _ risk _ categories _ for _ coronary _ artery _ disease _ which _ is _ uh E uh E low _ cardiovascular _ fitness _ and _ also _ uh E you _ know _ the _ cholesterol _
uh-huh _
it _ gives _ you _ increased _ h _ d _ ls _ and _ decreases _ your _ l _ d _ ls _
oh _ that _ 's _ great _
yeah _
so _
yeah _
i E 've E i _ 've _ definitely _ noticed _ it _ 's _ had _ a _ good _ effect _ on _ my _ pulse _ rate _ my _ resting _ pulse _
yeah _
you _ know _ it _ gets _ it _ down _ to _ about _ forty _
really _
yeah _
that _ 's _ good _
yeah _
you _ say _ you _ ride _ about _ a _ hundred _ hundred _ fifty _ miles _ a _ week _
yeah _
man _
that E 's E that _ 's _ hard-core _
on _ average _
yeah _
when _ do _ you _ get _ to _ begin _ with _ the _ winters _ and _ all _ that _
what _ time _ of _ the _ year _ do _ you _ usually _ embark _ on _ your _
do _ you _ ride _ inside _ if _ you _ ca _ n't _ ride _ outside _
no _
i _ 'm _ not _ that _ hard-core _
i _ mean _ there _ are _ some _ people _
in _ fact _ a _ lot _ of _ people _ will _ ride _ outside _ in _ the _ snow _
they _ 've _ got _ a _ uh _ mountain _ bike _ you _ know _ with _ the _ big _ knobby _ tires _
yeah _
and _ i _ do _ n't _ do _ that _
i E basically E i E i _ pretty _ much _ lay _ off _ for _ the _ winter _
uh _ i _ was _ thinking _ of _ getting _ rollers _ for _ the _ last _ winter _ you _ know _ because _ it _ will _ help _ your _ balance _ when _ you _ 're _ indoor _ training _
um _
uh _ but _ i _ just _ you _ know _ more _ or _ less _ stocked _ like _ an _ exercise _ bike _ and _ that _ kind _ of _ thing _ uh _
but _ yeah _
i _ mean _ winters _ are _ kind _ of _ a _ problem _
so _ i _ 'm _ more _ or _ less _ out _ of _ shape _ now _ that _ i _ 've _ been _ biking _ i _ guess _ this _ year _ for _ just _ a _ couple _ of _ weeks _
uh-huh _
uh _ but _ you _ know _ up _ here _ it _ 's _ only _ stopped _ snowing _ since _ then _
yeah _
uh _ but _ yeah _
it E 's E it _ 's _ it _ 's _ it _ 's _ pretty _ good _
it _ 's _ uh _
the E main E the _ main _ thing _ i _ guess _ for _ me _ is _ just _ to _ enjoy _ it _ because _ once _ it _ starts _ seeming _ like _ you _ know _ exercise _ and _ a _ chore _ i _ 'll _ lay _ off _ it _ more _
right _
so _ you _ uh _ change _ up _ your _ routes _ a _ lot _ and _ keep _ a _
oh _ yeah _
yeah _
i _ try _ to _ go _ someplace _ pretty _ different _ you _ know _ every _ week _
i _ rotate _ around _ uh _ about _ four _ different _ routes _ uh _ from _ my _ house _
or _ i _ 'll _ sometimes _ come _ in _ the _ school _
it _ 's _ nice _ coming _
it E 's E it _ 's _ nice _ riding _ to _ school _ because _ it _ 's _ all _ along _ a _ canal _ path _ uh E
because _ it E 's E just E it _ 's _ along _ the _ erie _ canal _ up _ here _
so _ what _ school _ is _ it _
uh _ university _ of _ rochester _
oh _ okay _
yeah _
so _ it _ 's _ fairly _ picturesque _
yeah _
and E uh E so _ it E 's E it _ 's _ it _ 's _ a _ good _ ride _
as _ long _ as _ you _ 're _ not _ doing _ it _ every _ day _ it _ 's _ a _ good _ ride _
yeah _
that _ 's _ true _
sounds _ neat _
yeah _
it _ 's _ kind _ of _
i _ was _ wondering _ if _ i _ was _ going _ to _ talk _ with _ someone _ that _ never _ has _ exercised _ before _ and _ does _ n't _ want _ to _ and _ everything _ else _
but _ got _ a _ guy _ that _ rides _ a _ hundred _ and _ fifty _ miles _ a _ week _
that _ 's _ uh _ motivating _
yeah _
that _ 's _ really _ good _
well _ good _ talking _ to _ you _
oh _ it _ was _ good _ talking _ to _ you _
and _ keep _ up _ the _ good _ work _
okay _
you _ too _
all _ right _
take _ care _
bye _
bye _
okay _
uh E far _ as _ you _ know _ crime _ in _ the _ cities _ i _ 'm _ sure _ like _ in _ yours _ it _ 's _ pretty E pretty _ bad _
uh _ probably _ the _ biggest _ thing _ we _ 've _ got _ going _ now _ is _ the _ robberies _
and _ theft _ and _ probably _ murder _ are _ the _ two _ top _ ones _ that _ we _ have _
uh-huh _
how _ about _ you _
uh _ well _ i _ do _ n't _ actually _ live _ in _ the _ city _
but _ i _ 'd _ probably _ say _ that _ 's _ roughly _ right _
i _ mean _ crimes _ against _ property _ seem _ to _ outnumber _ crimes _ against _ life _
but _ i E i _ think _ with _ the _ current _ war _ on _ drugs _ and _ all _ this _ kind _ of _ stuff _ i _ 'd _ say _ probably _ the _ police _ department _ would _ claim _ the _ number _ one _ crimes E crimes _ are _ probably _ solicitation _ of _ prostitution _ uh E and _ sale _ of _ drugs _
uh-huh _
probably _ right _ if _ you _ look _ at _ it _ from _ that _ stand _ point _
uh-huh _
what _ uh _
is _ there _ anything _ uh _ that _ you _ particularly _ are _ concerned _ with _ in _ your _ particular _ area _ as _ far _ as _ security _ and _ that _ sort _ of _ thing _
uh E where _ i _ live _ now _ it E 's E it _ 's _ not _ so _ bad _
i _ mean _ i _ can _ basically _ leave _ my _ front _ door _ unlocked _ and _ not _ have _ to _ worry _ about _ it _
uh _ but _ i _ do _ have _ friends _ that _ live _ in _ the _ city _
and _ i _ think _ that _ they _ get _ a _ lot _ of _ fallout _ from _ this _ war _ on _ drug _ thing _ uh _ just _ because _ there _ are _ like _ crack _ houses _ you _ know _ on _ their _ street _ and _ stuff _ like _ this _
uh-huh _
do _ you _ live _ in _ a _ real _ small _ town _ or E or _ out _ in _ the _ country _
i _ live _ out _ in _ the _ country _
yeah _
how _ far _ out _ from _ the _ city _ i _ mean _ do _ you _
i _ 'm _ about _ fifteen _ miles _ out _
about _ fifteen _ miles _
i _ live _ in _ a _ little _ suburb _ uh E which _ is E i _ guess _ from _ dallas _ is _ twelve _ miles _ or _ so _
uh-huh _
but _ it _ 's _ pretty _ congested _
we _ are _ considered _ in _ the _ country _
um _
but _ it _ does _ n't _ really _ feel _ like _ you _ 're _ in _ the _ country _
um _
our _ major _ crimes _ in _ our _ immediate _ town _ uh E is _ probably _ robberies E house _ robberies _ and _ very _ few _ instances _ of _ you _ know _ alcohol _ drugs _ uh E reported _
uh-huh _
however _ i _ 'm _ sure _ they _ 're _ there _
uh-huh _
but _ uh E right _ now _ our _ neighborhood _ is _ running _ about _ uh E eighty _ percent _ of _ the _ homeowners _ have _ been _ robbed _ sometime _ during _ their E their _ uh E existence _ in _ that _ neighborhood _
wow _
that _ 's _ huge _
and _ since _ that _ time _ everybody _ 's _ got _ some _ sort _ of _ burglar _ system _ or _ you _ know _ uh E burglar _ alarms _ uh E and E including _ the E out E uh E the _ outer _ perimeter _ type _ uh E devices _ sensors _ and _ things _ like _ that _
uh-huh _
uh-huh _
it _ 's _ cut _ back _ you _ know _ considerably _
but _ it E it _ just _ shifts _ it _ from _ our _ neighborhood _ to _ another _ neighborhood _ to _ other _ neighborhood _
so _ it _ still _ uh E remains _ city _ wide _ pretty E pretty _ high _
are E there E are _ there _ any _ theories _ on _ why _ this _ is _ happening _
uh _ i _ would _ say _ the _ majority _ of _ it _ 's _ happening _ during _ the _ day _ uh _ between _ probably _ ten _ in _ the _ morning _ and _ three _ in _ the _ afternoon _
uh-huh _
most _
but _ why _
why _ is _ it _ happening _
well E most E families E most _ families _ are _ young _
and _ both _ people _ are _ working _
uh-huh _
so _ they _ 're _ happening _ during _ the _ hours _ they _ 're _ gone _ from _ work _
uh-huh _
uh _ so _ uh _ i _ would _ say _ that _ 's _ probably _ their _ prime _ motivation _
they E 'll E they _ 'll _ stock _ your _ house _ and _ uh E look _ at _ your _ pattern _ and _ then _ go _ from _ there _
so _ they _ 're _ professionals _
uh _ they _ classify _ most _ of _ them _ as _ professionals _
um _
uh E you _ get _ a _ few _ of _ them _ that _ are _ a _ little _ bit _ sloppier _ uh E just _ taking _ uh E you _ know _ just _ junk _ items _ that _ they E they _ can _ just _ get _ you _ know _ ten _ to _ twenty _ bucks _ for _ real _ quick _
uh-huh _
probably _ the _ biggest _ items _ that E uh E that _ you _ get _ in _ our _ neighborhood _ or E would _ be _ the _ high _ classed _ automobiles _
the _ you _ know _ mercedes _ volvos _ things _ that _ they _ can _ get _ you _ know _ big _ dollars _ for _ and _ the _ jewelry _ are _ the _ major _ targets _
uh-huh _
guns _ that _ sort _ of _ stuff _
um _
very _ few _ you _ know _ penny E penny _ ante _ stuff _
well _ what _ do _ you _ think _ can _ be _ done _ to _ reduce _ that _ sort _ of _ crime _
well _ uh _ the _ police _ force _ for _ one _
i _ think _ they _ could _ uh _ definitely _ add _ to _ the _ police _ force _ and _ the _ type _ equipment _ that _ they _ use _
uh _ it _ 's _
oh _ right _ now _ i _ think _ we _ are _ about _ thirty _ thousand _ people _
and _ there _ 's _ only _ eight _ officers _ that _ patrol _ for E thirty E for _ that _ amount _ of _ people _ which _ is _ not _ very _ many _
uh-huh _
uh-huh _
right _
and _
but _ i _ mean _ that _ 's _ going _ to _ tend _ to _
i _ mean _ it _ seems _ to _ me _ that _ sort _ of _ approach _ will _ tend _ to _ simply _ make _ the _ cost _ of _ committing _ the _ crime _ slightly _ higher _
in _ other _ words _ you _ 've _ increased _ the _ probability _ of _ somebody _ being _ caught _ a _ little _ bit _
the _ real _ question _ is _ how _ do _ you _ convince _ people _ not _ to _ commit _ such _ crimes _ in _ the _ first _ place _
well _ the _
course _ in _ our _ particular _ state _ uh _ we _ have _ the _ prison _ overcrowding _ whatever _
so _ they _ 're _ giving _ the _ early _ release _ uh _
right _
they _ 're _ doing _ that _ in _ our _ state _ too _
yeah _
and E and _ it _ 's _
i _ think _ what _ they _ need _ to _ do _ is _ stop _ building _ more _ jails _ and _ start _ giving _ stiffer _ sentences _ uh _
but _ for _ the _
so _ you _ think _ that _ would _ be _ a _ deterrent _
that _ would _ be E certainly _ be _ a _ deterrent _
uh-huh _
and _ uh _ not _ necessarily _ you _ know _ give _ in _ to _ their _ uh _ human _ rights _ desires _
you _ know _ if _ they _ 're _ overcrowded _ just _ keep _ cramming _ them _ in _ there _ till _ they _ just _ suffocate _ uh _
well _ what _ about _ an _ innocent _ person _ who _ happens _ to _ have _ been _ found _ guilty _
uh _ i _ think _ they _ 'd _ have _ to _ go _ to _ extra _ measures _ to _ make _ sure _ a _ person _ 's _ guilty _ you _ know _ in _ a _ lot _ of _ cases _
course _ i E i _ know _ you _ ca _ n't _ be _ a _ hundred _ percent _ foolproof _
right _
uh _
so _ you E 'd E you _ 'd _ rather _ see _ it _ harder _ to _ convict _ somebody _
i _ 'd _ rather _ see _ it _ a _ little _ bit _ harder _ and _ have _ a _ little _ bit _ more _ evidence _ uh _ to _ convict _ somebody _
uh-huh _
and _ then _ those _ convicted _ especially _ of _ you _ know _ murder _ and E and _ uh E you _ know _ major _ crimes _ uh E to _ reach _ the _ life _ sentences _ and _ you _ know _ death _ penalties _ and _ follow-through _ with _ that _
uh-huh _
huh _
uh _ especially _ you _ know _ in _ the _ case _ of _ murder _
right _
uh E i _ know _ in _ my _ case _ i E my _ wife _ and _ daughter _ were _ kidnapped _ during _ a _ house _ robbery _ back _ in _ eighty-five _
oh _ wow _
oh _ my _ goodness _
and _ we E caught E the _ individuals _ got _ caught _
we E uh E we _ went _ through _ the _ court _ system _ and _ all _ that _ sort _ of _ thing _
uh-huh _
and _ uh E you _ know _ two _ counts _ of _ kidnapping _ uh E you _ know _ the E the _ forty-five _ to _ the _ head _ you _ know _ just _ the E the _ mental _ anguish _ and _ the _ whole _ nine _ yards _ uh E you _ know _ the _ guy _ only _ got _ five _ years _
uh-huh _
right _
wow _
and _ you _ know _ he _ was _ out _ within _ two _ months _ because _ of _ the _ parole _ system _
so _ what E what _
did E you E did _ you _ sue _ him _ under _ the _ civil _ system _
do _ what _ now _
did _ you _ sue _ him _ under _ the _ civil _ system _
no _
i _ 'm _ not _ real _ familiar _ with _ that _
well _ you _ could _ probably _ sue _ him _ for _ mental _ anguish _ or _ something _ right _ and _ try _ to _ get _ money _ from _ him _
oh _
and _
well E the _ insurance _ companies _ and _ all _ that _ tried E to E tried _ to _ go _ after _ him _
and _ they _ said _ well E you _ know _ he E they _ 're _ he _ has _ no _ job _
he _ has _ nothing _
there _ 's _ nothing _ that _ he _ has _ that E that _ you _ could _ go _ after _
yeah _
makes _ you _ wish _ that _ had E uh E still _ had _ indentured _ servitude _ for _ this _ sort _ of _ thing _
yeah _
uh _ very _
but _ they _ give _ the _ guy _ a _ job _ in _ prison _ and _ make _ him _ pay _ his _ damn _ debt _
yeah _
they _ do _ n't _ do _ that _ here _
course _ they _ pay _ them _
but _ they E do E n't E you _ do _ n't _
you _ or _ the _ insurance _ companies _ never _ see _ any _ of _ that _ money _
yeah _
that _ 's _ too _ bad _
and E uh E you _ know _ and _ they E 're E right _ now _ they _ 're _ reluctant _ to _ go _ after _ him _ because _ they E 're E you _ know _ they _ 're _ they _ 're _ repeat _ offenders _
they _ uh _ been _ in _ jail _ before _
uh-huh _
uh-huh _
they _ 've _ been _ released _ you _ know _ several _ times _ which _ is _ another _ uh _ deal _ i _ hate _ to _ see _
uh-huh _
uh-huh _
but _ uh E you _ know _ basically _ the _ guy _ commits _ you _ know _ three _ major _ crimes _ and E and _ uh E and _ car _ theft _ on _ top _ of _ it _ destroys _ my _ car _
yeah _
i E i _ think _ that _ 's _
yeah _
yeah _
and _ we _ 're _ out _ you _ know _ uh _ you _ know _ fifteen _ thousand _ dollars _
and _ you _ know _ the _ guy _ gets _ out _ in _ two _ months _
that _ 's _ awful _
and _ he _ goes _ out _ and _ commits _ it _ again _
fact _ he _ 's _ back _ in _ jail _ now _
so _ what E what _ uh E
gives _ you _ sympathy _ for _ the _ vigilantes _
yeah _
what E what _ deterrent _ does _ he _ really _ have _
yeah _
yeah _
i _ think _ in E our E in _ our _ particular _ neighborhood _ vigilantism _ is _ becoming _ a _ real E real _ possibility _
uh-huh _
uh E we _ 've _ had _ a _ couple _ instances E where E break _ ins _ where _ the _ people _ have _ actually _ you _ know _ shot _ the _ people _
oh _ my _ god _
and _ uh _ return _ offenders _ have _
they _ 've _ actually _ waited _ for _ them _ where _ they _ 've _ robbed _ you _ know _ particular _ neighborhood _
they _ 'll _ rob _ one _ house _
then _ other _ people _ will _ wait _ up _ you _ know _ and _ wait _ for _ somebody _ to _ do _ something _ else _ try _ to _ take _ it _ in _ their _ own _ hands _
right _
course _ it _ does _ n't _ always _ work _ out _ in _ their _ favor _
right _
but _ uh _ nevertheless _ i _ think _ people _ are _ just _ getting _ fed _ up _ and _ saying _ you _ know _ you _ ca _ n't _ arrest _ all _ of _ us _
uh-huh _
you E can E you _ know _ you _ can _ get _ some _ of _ us _
right _
you _ ca _ n't _ get _ all _ of _ us _
uh-huh _
uh _ and _ we _ 're _ beginning _ to _ see _ more _ and _ more _ of _ that _
and _ that E that _ 's _ a _ deterrent _ too _ if _ you _ think _ the _ home _ owner _ might _ be _ armed _ right E and _ awake _
yeah _
here _ you _ break _ in _
and _ you _ 're _ going _ to _ get _ shot _
yeah _
that E 's E i _ mean _ that _ 's _ certainly _ a _ possibility _ in E in _
we _ have _ had _ a _ few _ cases _ where _ the _ guy _ has _ broken _ in _ you _ know _ during _ the _ middle _ of _ the _ night _ and _ gotten _ himself _ shot _ to _ death _
uh-huh _
and _ uh _ it _ helps _ for _ a _ while _
uh-huh _
but _ then _ just _ another _ different _ set _ of _ people _ come _ in _
and _ most _ of _ the _ people _ are _ transients _ from _ out E outside _ of _ the _ state _
huh _
uh E i _ would _ say _ probably _ eighty _ percent _ of _ them _ that _ are _ caught _ they _ 're _ from _ places _ like _ up _ in _ oklahoma _ and _ louisiana _ arkansas _ you _ know _ across _ the E the _ border _
wow _
so _ you _ know _ people _ who _ do _ n't _ readily _ read _ the _ newspapers _ in _ our _ town _ or _ whatever _
uh-huh _
it _ 's _ not _ many _ from _ the _ local _ communities _
uh-huh _
but _ uh _ it _ 's _ a _ problem _
and _ i E i _ just _ i _ think _ that _ the _ court _ systems _ need _ to _ be _ more E accurate E in E in _ stiffer _ in _ their _ penalties _
yeah _
would _ be _ a _ definite _ deterrent _
and E and _ uh E giving _ the _ uh E police _ uh E agencies _ a _ little _ bit _ more _ jurisdiction _ over _ what _ they _ do _ when E they E when _ they _ catch _ these _ people _
yeah _
uh-huh _
i _ mean _ i E i _ tend _ to _ agree _ with _ you _
i _ think _ uh E what _ i _ would _ like _ to _ see _ is _ number _ one _ completely _ getting _ rid _ of _ these _ victimless _ crimes _ uh E there _ 's _ no _ reason _ to _ enforce _ those _ and _ spend _ time _ and _ money _ doing _ it _ and E and _ worry _ about _ these _ things _ where _ people _ are _ getting _ hurt _
right _
and _ i _ think _ one _ of _ the _ big _ things _ that _ you _ can _ do _ is E to _ increase _ deterrence _ is _ uh E if _ someone _ is _ found _ guilty _ of _ a _ uh E felony _ level _ offense _ they _ lose _ their _ citizenship _
and _ they _ lose _ their _ constitutional _ rights _ you _ know _
uh-huh _
and _ just _ a _ lot _ of _ things _ that _ we _ 're _ trying _ to _ worry _ about _ you _ know _ protecting _ these _ people _ from _ we _ just _ do _ n't _ protect _ them _
i _ know _ like _ in _ my _ wife _ 's _ case _ they _ made _ her _ feel _ like _ the _ criminal _
i _ know _
and _ i E think E i _ think _ that _ 's _ ridiculous _
they E they _ went _ to _ all E all _
okay _
have _ you _ painted _ something _ lately _
yes _
i _ have _
that _ room _ i _ showed _ you _
yeah _
and _ then _ since _ then _ we _ have _ painted _ the _ bedroom _
oh _ yeah _
another _ bedroom _
yeah _
i _ showed _ you _ that _ one _ too _ did _ n't _ i _
the _ brown _ one _
yeah _
yeah _
yeah _
yeah _
the _ one _ that _ looks _ like _ a _ fudgesicle _
oh _ yeah _
yeah _
oh _ heavens _
well _ i _ painted _ the _ outside _ of _ my _ house _ and _ one _ bathroom _
yeah _
but _ i E get E i _ have _ that _ problem _ with _ the E the _ ceiling _ you _ know _ the E uh E the _ blown E blown _ ceiling _ you _ know _ where _ you _ get _ around _ the _ edge _
oh _ yeah _
well _ that _ is _ hard _
now _ i _ asked _ janice _ or _ somebody _ recently _ how _ you _ do _ that _ uh _ when _ you _ paint _ the _ ceilings _ you _ know _ where _ you _ have _ got _ that _ textured _ stuff _ that _ they _ have _ special _ rollers _ that _ are _ real _ soft _ and _ furry _ that _ you _ paint _ that _ with _
uh-huh _
uh-huh _
well _ how _ do _ you _ get _ the _ edge _ though _
how _ do _ you _ get _ the _ edge _
the E the _ straight _ edge _
you _ just _ have _ to _ be _ real _ careful _
oh _ i _ see _
we _ use _ uh E uh E a _ two _ inch _ brush _ with E uh E on _ a _ slant _
uh-huh _
uh-huh _
and _ that _ mostly _ does _ it _ even _ though _ you _ still _ make _ mistakes _
but _
huh _ well _ are _ you _ going _ to _ paint _ the _ outside _ of _ your _ house _ too _
well _ yeah _
i _ think _ i _ am _ going _ to _ do _ it _ this _ spring _ actually _
oh _ really _
yeah _
there _ are _ six _ houses _
see E the _ people _ that _ own _ the _ house _ they _ uh E pay _ for _ anything _ like _ that _ that _ we _ do _ as _ far _ as _ the E the _ materials _
oh _ nice _
there _ are _ three _ houses _ on _ this _ street _ the _ same _ color _ of _ yellow _ out _ of _ six _ houses _
yeah _
so _ i _ am _ thinking _ i _ am _ going _ to _ change _ it _ to _ uh _ something _ you _ know _
the _ brick _ is _ multi _ color _ mostly _ earth _ tones _
uh-huh _
oh _ that _ will _ be _ nice _
huh _
or E two E tone E or _ two _ tone _ you _ know _
yeah _
there _ are _ some _ columns _ that _ could _ be _ painted _ a _ different _ color _ too _
uh-huh _
what _ color _ did _ you _ paint _ your _ house _
white _
on _ the _ out _
but _ i _ have _ a _ problem _
i _ ca _ n't _ get _ up _ high _
and _ we _ ca _ n't _ paint _ the _ chimney _
well _ you _ have _ got _ to _ get _ one _ of _ those _ ladders _
we _ have _ one _ of _ those _ ladders _
we _ are _ just _ not _ willing _ to _ get _ up _ that _ high _
oh _ yeah _
a _ friend _ of _ mine _ that _ lives _ out _ in _ your _ neighborhood _ he _ has _ done _ his _ house _
and _ that _ is _ what _ he _
i _ was _ out _ there _ last _ week _
and _ he _ has _ finished _ everything _ except _ the _ chimney _
well _ we _ did _ too _
we _ did _ it _ in _ the _ fall _
and _ it E it _ 's _ just _ too _ high _
it _ is _ really _ scary _
but E and _ the _ only _ thing _ i _ would _ consider _ doing E a E professional E maybe E doing E that E
yeah _
but _ it _
other _ than _ doing _ our _ own _ work _ i _ prefer _ it _ to _ a _ professional _
well _ our _ house _ in _ new _ mexico _ it _ was _ stucco _
but _ we _ had _ all _ this _ trim _ to _ paint _ and _ lots _ of _ it _
yeah _
and _ we _ did _ basically _ seventy-five _ percent _ of _ the _ house _
and _ then _ i _ was _ afraid _ to _ do _ the _ eaves _ way _ up _ high _ and _ stuff _
uh-huh _
so _ i _ hired _ this _ man _ to _ come _ in _ and _ do _ it _ a _ young _ kid _
uh-huh _
and _ he _ came _ with E with _ his _ own _
what _ do _ you _ call _ those _ things _
the _ blowers _
no _
those _ where _ you _ built _ like _ a _ rafter _ thing _
oh _ oh _ oh _ oh _ i _ know _ what _ you _ are _ talking _ about _ uh _
yeah _
scaffold _
scaffold _
that _ 's _ it _
he _ came _ and _ did _ it _ that _ way _
and _ i _ think _ he _ charged _ me _ a _ hundred _ dollars _ to _ finish _ up _
huh _
and _ literally _ i _ would _ n't _ have _ done _ it _ with _ the _ scaffolds _ because _ all _ the _ places _ that _ i _ had _ left _ for _ him _ were _ above _ huge _ humongous _ cactus _
its _
yeah _
and _ if _ he _ fell _ he _ was _ dead _
and _ he _ knew _ that _
so _
oh _ my _
so _ that _ was _ worth _ it _ getting _ a _ professional _ for _ that _
yeah _
plus _ he _ cleaned _ up _ my _ mess _
oh _ i _ think _ that _ is _ what _ we _ might _ have _ to _ do _ with _ this _ chimney _
but _ other _ than _ that _ it _ was _ pretty _ easy _ doing _ it _ ourself _ and _ caulking _ it _ and _ everything _ ourself _
uh-huh _
it _ was _ n't _ too _ bad _
i _ mean _ you _ think _
how _ much _ did _ it _ cost _ you _ for _ the _ paint _ for _ the _ outside _
shoot _ maybe _ a _ hundred _ and _ fifty _
yeah _
since _ it _ is _ a _ one _ story _
but _ we _ did _ uh _ like _ two _ heavy _ coats _ over _ it _
but _ then _ that _ way _ you _ know _ you _ are _ assured _ you _ did _ a _ good _ job _ than _ you _ are _ you _ know _ if _ you _ hire _ someone _ to _ do _ it _
yeah _
but _ that _ friend _ of _ mine _ that _ painted _ his _ house _ out _ there _ in _ your _ neighborhood _ he _ went _ to E uh E i _ guess _ to _ buy _ his _ paint _
uh-huh _
uh-huh _
uh-huh _
and _ yet _ he _ bought _ like _ seventeen _ gallons _
my _ word _
and _ anyway _ he E when _ he _ checked _ out _ and _ he _ was _ using _ his _ charge _ card _ too _ they _ only _ charged _ him _ for _ one _ gallon _ of _ paint _ like E thirteen _ bucks _ or _ something _
uh-huh _
uh-huh _
oh _ my _ word _
and _ he E had E he _ had _ the _ uh E he _ had _ already _ carried _ a _ ladder _ outside _ and _ told _ her _ that _
uh-huh _
and _ she _ wrung _ all _ that _ stuff _ up _ and _ made _ a _ mistake _ on _ the _ price _ of _ the _ paint _
uh-huh _
so _ she _ had _ to _ start _ all _ over _ again _
uh-huh _
and _ when _ he _ got _ outside _ he _ noticed _ his _ receipt _ was _ like _ thirteen _ ninety-nine _ or _ something _
oh _ my _ word _
and _ he _ saw _
so _ that _ was _ really _ worth _ it _ painting _ his _ own _ house _
yeah _
it _ was _ like _ over _ two _ hundred _ dollars _ worth _ of _ free _ stuff _
oh _ my _ word _
oh _ my _ word _
well _ he _ really _ saved _ in _ that _ way _
yeah _
but _ yeah _
i _ think _ we _ are _ going _ to _ do _ uh _ another _ bathroom _
but _ i _ think _ i _ will _ probably _ just _ do _ it _ in _ a _ roller _
i _ want _ to _ do _ it _ about _ the _ same _ color _ and _ just _ be _ a _ little _
uh _ rollers _ are _ so _ messy _
we _ never _ any _ more _
oh _ i _ know _
but _ it E 's E that E it _ 's _ the _ textured _ wall _
well _ a _ little _ paintbrush _
so _ what _ do _ you _ think _
uh _ the _ causes _ of _ crime _
um _ i _ think _ it _ was _ imbalance _ of _ power _ in _ the _ united _ states _
it _ 's _ causing _ the _ lower _ class _ to _ rebel _
that _ 's _ why _ there _ 's _ such _ high _ crime _
and _ uh _ there _ 's _ crime _ in _ uh _ young _ people _ because _ they _ do _ n't _ have _ role _ models _
yeah _
see _ too _ much _ crime _ on _ t _ v _
and _ they _ think _ it _ 's _ the _ way _ to _ go _
i _ do _ n't _ know _
what _ do _ you _ think _
what _ about _
i _ agree _ with _ the _ upper _ and _ lower _ level _ you _ know _
uh-huh _
because _ that _ 's _ the _ lowest _ thing _ for _ themselves _
plus _ there _ 's _ nobody _ for _ them _ to _ look _ up _ to _
yeah _
but _ i _ also _ blame _ some _ of _ it _ on _ parents _
okay _
because _ parents _ are _ n't _ parents _
yeah _
because _ i _ remember _ even _ when _ i _ was _ growing _ up _
i _ 'm _ thirty-five _
okay _
i _ remember _ when _ i _ was _ growing _ up _
and _ i _ had _ friends _
they _ used _ to _ do _ stuff _ like _ you _ know _ go _ over _ to _ a _ store _ and _ steal _ stuff _
my _ mother _ warned _ us _ it _ 's _ like _ i _ do _ n't _ care _ what _ your _ friends _ do _
if _ you _ do _ it _ then _ that _ was _ it _
yeah _
and _ i _ knew _ that _ i _ would _ get _ in _ more _ trouble _ from _ my _ mother _ than E from _ from _ anybody _ else _
from _ anybody _ else _
and _ i _ think _ that _ 's _ the _ basic _ is _ they _ have _ no _ morals _ any _ more _
yeah _
so _ they _ do _ n't _ care _
yeah _
so _
yeah _
i _ think _ i _ can _ agree _ with _ that _ too _
but _ now _ as _ far _ as _ what _ they _ can _ do _ about _ it _ i _ do _ n't _ know _
you _ ca _ n't _ make _ parents _ be _ parents _
that _ 's _ true _
you _ got _ to _ kind _ of _ make _ people _ want _ to _ do _ the _ right _ thing _
you _ know _
i _ do _ n't _ know _ how _ you _ do _ that _
i _ guess _ if _ you _ gave E the E gave _ them _ jobs _
that _ 's _ another _ problem _ with _ the _ united _ states _
there _ 's _ no _ jobs _ any _ more _
yeah _
but _
well E i _ 've _ heard _ this _ one _ theory _ that _ if E that _ if _ a _ kid _ commits _ a _ crime _ that _ uh E instead _ of _ the E prosecuting _ the _ kid _ they _ prosecute _ the _ parent _
or _ both _ of _ them _
that _ would _ work _ to _ a _ point _
now _ to _ put _ the _ blame _ on _ the _ parent _
well _ that _ 'd _ work _ to _ a _ point _ because _ some _ kids _ are _ just _ bad _ anyway _
i _ do _ n't _ care _ what _ you _ do _ to _ them _
yeah _
you _ know _
so _ i _ think _ it _ depends _ on _ how _ much _ trouble _ that _ kid _ has _ been _ in _ you _ know _
yeah _
because _ a E a _ a _ child _ can _ get _ into _ anything _
yeah _
i _ do _ n't _ care _ how _ good _ you E they _ are _
yeah _
at _ least _ one _ time _
but _ now _ if _ this _ is _ a _ repeated _ thing _
here _ with _ this _ child _ in _ juvenile _
and E or _ to _ me _ yeah E both _ of _ them _
yeah _
because _ that _ means _ she _ 's _ still _ not _ doing _ what _ she _ 's _ supposed _ to _ do _
because _ i _ just _ watched _ it _ on _ t _ v _ one _ night _ on _ one E of E them E um E twenty _ twenty _ forty-eight _ hours _ one _ of _ them _ shows _ where _ this _ boy _ had _ been _ stealing _ cars _
uh-huh _
yeah _
i _ do _ n't _ know _ if _ you _ seen _ this _
um _
it E was E a E little E it _ was _ a _ little _ gang _ of _ them _ stealing _ cars _ you _ know _
no _
i _ did _ n't _ see _ it _
i _ understand _
and _ then _ when _ they _ caught _ him _ you _ know _ his _ mother _ sitting _ there _
now _ they _ going _ to _ take _ me _ away _ from _ you _
that E meaned E she _ was _ warned _
yeah _
but _ see _ by _ that _ i _ think _ sometimes _ it _ 's _ a _ little _ late _
yeah _
you _ know _
but _ i _ 'm _ sure _ there _ 's _ something _ can _ be _ done _
yeah _
what _ about _ with _ adults _
anything _ do _ any _ about _ adult _ crime _
yeah _
start _ prosecuting _ they _
but _ really _ good _ instead _ of _ having _ a _ revolving _ door _ on _ the _ damn _ court _ system _
yeah _
well _ for _ one _ a _ major _ problem _ with _ that _ is _ the _ jails _ are _ overcrowded _
well _ they _ should _ start _ with _ the _
if _ they _ would _ get _ rid _ of _
seems _ to _ me _ i _ know _ there _ 's _ a _ lot _ about _ court _ that _ people _ do _ n't _ understand _
there _ 's _ more _ people _ in _ jail _ right _ now _ for _ child _ support _ okay _ then _ there _ are _ for _ people _ doing _ drugs _
uh-huh _
um _
you _ ought _ to _ take _ all _ them _ little _ misdemeanor _ people _
yeah _
let _ them _ go _
let _ them _ go _
yeah _
you _ know _ give _ them _ a _ fine _ whatever _
make _ them _ do _ civic _ duty _ whatever _
yeah _
i _ mean _ seriously _
put _ them _ fools _ in _ there _
they _ ought _ to _ put _ those _ people _ to _ work _
i _ call _ them _ all _ fools _ idiots _ whatever _
yeah _
little _ rock _ stars _ put _ all _ them _ in _ there _
um _
you _ know _ the _ murderers _ the _ drug _ dealers _ the _ user _ put _ them _ all _ in _
jail _ you _ know _
yeah _
and _ let _ all _ the _ normal _ people _ go _
yeah _
you _ know _ because _ okay _
if _ you _ write _ a _ bad _ check _ you _ go _ to _ jail _ right _
yeah _
let _ them E people _ go _
well _
not _ let _ them _ go _ and _ get _ out _ of _ it _
yeah _
they E you _ still _ have _ to _ punish _ them _
let _ them _ go _ and _ pay _ their _ crime _ or _ their _ time _ doing _ something _ else _ you _ know _ like _ cleaning _ up _ the _ city _ or _ however _ they _ do _ their _ community _ time _ you _ know _ whatever _ that _ is _
yeah _
yeah _
that _ 's _
but _ do _ n't _ put _ them _ in _ jail _ because _ they _ 're _ not _ hardened _ criminals _
yeah _
and _ they E 're E they _ 're _ still _ they _ can _ provide _ for _ society _
whereas _ some _ of _ them _ are _ so _ far _ gone _ that _ they _ ca _ n't _ do _ anything _ good _ for _ society _
uh-huh _
so _
i _ do _ n't _ know _
some _ people _ boy _ they _ got _
i _ think _ the _ united _ states _ has _ got _ too _ many _ problems _ to _ be _ worrying _ about _ everybody _ else _
yeah _
that _ 's _ true _
now _ how _ they _ going _ to _ fix _ it _ i _ do _ n't _ know _
i _ do _ n't _ think _ there _ is _ a _ ready _ solution _
no _
i _ do _ n't _ think _ so _ either _
uh _
because _ the _ economy _ is _ down _ people E you _ know _ the E the _ the _ low _ man _ on _ the _ pole _ is _ getting _ more _ of _ the E i _ guess _ the _ bulk _ of _ it _
yeah _
and _ he _ 's _ got _ to _ work _ extra _ hard _ just _ to _ make _ ends _ meet _
and _ they _ keep _ taking _ more _ money _ from _ us _
uh-huh _
and _ people _ are E get _
and _ they _ do _ n't _ have _ any _ incentive _ to _ work _ if _ we _ 're _ just _ going _ to _ take _ fifty _ percent _ of _ it _
yeah _
might _ as _ well _ steal _
then _ they _ do _ n't _ have _ to _ pay _ taxes _ on _ it _
that _ 's _ it _
yeah _
so _ you _ know _ they E i _ i _ i _ know _ that _ 's _ bad _ but _ you _ know _ just _ like _ texas _ now _
uh-huh _
they _ could _ have _ had _ a _ lottery _
they _ do _ n't _ want _ a _ lottery _
why _ not _
i _ would _ rather _ pay _ for _ a _ lottery _ a _ dollar _ two _ three _ dollars _ whatever _ i _ 'm _ paying _ you _ know _ a _ week _ or _ whatever _ and _ never _ see _ any _ of _ that _ money _ than _ to _ have _ them _ take _ a _ portion _ of _ my _ paycheck _
they _ 'd _ have _ a _
yeah _
yeah _
because _ you _ know _ they _ take _
and _ uncle _ sam _ takes _ his _
the _ social _ security _ which _ probably _ wo _ n't _ be _ here _ when _ i _ get _ that _ old _ you _ know _
um _
because _ we _ 're _ paying _ for _ social _ security _ they _ using _ now _
yeah _
who _ 's _ going _ to _ pay _ for _ mine _
i _ do _ n't _ know _
but _ it E 's E it _ 's _
i _ 'm _ not _ counting _ on _ it _
no _
you _ do _ n't _ count _ on _ social _ security _
yeah _
but _ it E 's E it _ 's _
that _ 's _ what _ i _ 'm _ saying _
they _ need _ to _ do _ something _ else _
um _
but _
crime _ is _ going _ to _ go _ up _ as _ long _ as _ the _ economy _ stays _ down _
yeah _
and _ it _ 's _ going _ to _ get _ worse _
yeah _
that _ 's _ just _ like _ last _ night _ they _ killed _ them E people _ in _ that _ store _
where _ you _ at _
i _ 'm _ in _ raleigh _ north _ carolina _
oh _
no _ wonder _ you _ do _ n't _ know _ that _
well _ where _ are _ you _ from _
i _ 'm _ in _ dallas _
okay _
but _ last _ night _ they _ killed _ uh _ uh _ four _ people _ in _ a _ chain _ food _
oh _ man _
and _ killed _ them _
well _ it _ was _ two _ stores _ side _ by _ side _
uh-huh _
one _ was _ a _ store _ and _ one _ was _ like E a E a _ fast _ food _ place _
chicken _ or _ something _ i _ do _ n't _ know _
yeah _
anyway _ they E raped E the E women E beat _ them _ all _ up _ including _ the _ women _
i _ mean _ they _ just _ beat _ them _
stuck _ them _ in _ the _ freezer _ and _ then _ shot _ them _ all _
ow _
why E was E you _ know _ why _
why _ did _ they _ do _ in _ the _ freezer _
you _ know _ why _ did _ n't _ they _ just _
if _ they _ was _ going _ to _ lock E them E just _ lock _ them _ in _ the _ freezer _ take _ the _ money _ you _ know _
yeah _
they _ did _ n't _ have _ to _ kill _ them _ or _ rape _ them _ or _ anything _
um _
um _
that _ 's _ awful _
yeah _
we _ still _ get _ some _ in _ raleigh _
i _ mean _ not E not _ too _ often _ real _ bad _ ones _
uh-huh _
but _
it _ 's _ just _ getting _ really _ ridiculous _ down _ here _
i _ wish _ i _ could _ move _ somewhere _ where _ this E you _ know _ you _ got _ to _ like _ in _ the _ country _
i _ do _ n't _ think _ there _ 's _ anywhere _ where _ there _ is _ n't _ going _ to _ be _ crimes _
well _ i _ think _ if _ it _ 's _
the _ town _ is _ smaller _
uh-huh _
and _ everybody _ knows _ everybody _
yeah _
it _ 's _ harder _ to _ come _ in _ there _ and _ do _ something _
yeah _
where _ is _
and E and _ and _ see E that _ 's _ another _ thing _
neighborhoods _ are _ n't _ neighborhoods _ any _ more _
yeah _
there E 's E nobody _ is _ next _ door _ to _ you _
you _ do _ n't _ know _ your _ neighbors _ and _ stuff _ like _ that _
yeah _
it _ 's _ just _ huh-uh _ you _ know _
because _ i _ moved _ out _ some _ apartments _ before _ because _ they _ were _ loaded _ with _ drug _ dealers _
um _
and _ you _ did _ n't _ even _
and _ what E the E manager E the _ manager _ wo _ n't _ even _ do _ anything _
he _ 's _ probably _ a _ drug _ dealer _ himself _
uh-huh _
you _ never _ know _
you _ do _ n't _
and _ so _ i _ moved _
because _ i _ moved _ the _ day _ probably _ a _ week _ after _ one _ of _ the _ apartments _ blew _ up _ you _ know _
wow _
and _ this _ is _ like _ across _ the _ street _
this _ was _ a _ nice _ part _ of _ town _
um _
and _ there _ across _ the _ street _ one _ of _ the _ apartments _ blew _ up _ because _ they _ were _ having E that E making _ that _ um E crack _ stuff _
um _
and _ then _ the _ other _ time _ i _ saw _ the _ cops _ break _ down _ somebody _ 's _ apartment _ around _ the _ corner _
i _ say _ see _ this _ is _ it _
time _ to _ go _
that _ 's _ it _
and _ i _ moved _
yeah _
and _ you _ know _ now _ i _ live _ in _ like E a E a _ neighborhood _ in _ a _ town _ house _
but _ it _ 's _ nice _
i _ do _ n't _ you _ know _
yeah _
i _ 'm _ kind _ of _ in _ the _ same E same _ kind _ of _ deal _ town _ house _ in _ a _ neighborhood _
but _
it _ 's _ pretty _ nice _
i _ do _ n't _ know _ how _ they _ can _ live _ a _ neighborhood _ or _ apartment _ complex _
that E 's E what E happen E that _ 's _ what _ wrong _ you _ know _
i _ do _ n't _ think _ do _ n't _ rent _ to _ them _
yeah _
or _ rent _ to _ them _ and _ evict _ them _ because _ they _ drug _ dealers _
put _ it _ on _ the _ lease _
yeah _
if _ you _ deal _ drugs _ you _ ca _ n't _ live _ here _
yeah _
most _ of _ them _ are _ too _ scared _ to _ do _ anything _ about _ it _
uh-huh _
that _ 's _ it _
yeah _
all _ right _
well _ listen _ i _ got _ to _ go _
all _ righty _
nice _ talking _ to _ you _
and _ i _ thank _ you _
all _ right _
bye-bye _
bye-bye _
um _
hi _
one _ thing _ you _ know _ that _ i _ always _ think _ about _ when _ i _ think _ of _ public _ education _
cause _ i _ went _ through _ the _ public _ um _ school _ system _ of _ boston _
uh-huh _
and _ uh _ i _ always _ felt _ that _ i _ graduated _ high _ school _
and _ i E still E did E n't E even E i E i _ could _ n't _ put _ together _ a _ map _ of _ the _ united _ state _
um _
you _ know _ what _ i _ mean _
uh-huh _
an _ yet _ i _ felt _ that _ i _ got _ a _ good _ education _
and _ i E i _ did _ well _ in _ school _
but _ you _ tell _ me _ to _ name _ you _ know _ five _ continents _
an _ i _ could _ n't _ do _ it _
uh-huh _
i _ just _ felt _ like _ there _ were _ some _ real _ basics _ that _ are _ missing _ from _ education _
uh _
and _ the _ people _ are E are _ leaving _ school _ not _ even _ knowing _ some _ common _ sense _ things _
yeah _
one _
well E talking _ about _ public _ education _ um E i E 'm E we _ 're _ doing _ a _ proposal _
uh-huh _
it E 's E we _ 're _ doing _ it _ at _ n _ c _ state _
yeah _
we _ 're _ trying _ to _ improve _ the _ computer _ science _ curriculum _
uh-huh _
so _ that _ 's _ kind _ of _ in _ a _ higher _ level _
right _
so _ it _ 's _ interesting _ that _ you _ chose _ that _ topic _
yeah _
um _ did _ you _ do _ through _ a _ public _ school _ system _ or _ private _
yeah _
well E i _ went _ through _ private _ an E until _ ninth _ grade _
uh-huh _
did _ you _ notice _ a _ big _ difference _
oh _ yeah _
a _ big _ difference _
like _ in _ what _ sense _
well E um E in _ uh E public _ schools _ i _ guess _ there E there _ are _ a _ lot _ of E of _ you _ know _
people _ can _ take _ lower _ level _ courses _ an _ get _ away _ with _ learning _ nothing _
uh-huh _
but _ um _ private _ school _ you _ could _ n't _ do _ that _
uh-huh _
you _ had _ to _ learn _
yeah _
i _ work _ in _ a _ temporary _ agency _
an _ they _ 're _ people _ that _ come _ in _ you _ know _ every _ day _ to _ fill _ out _ an _ application _
uh-huh _
and _ they _ 'll _ have _ to _ bring _ somebody _ with _ them _
and _ they _ will _ show _ that _ they _ completed _ um _ four _ year _ of _ high _ school _
yet _ when _ it _ comes _ to _ even _ answering _ the _ questions _ on _ a _ simple _ application _ they _ ca _ n't _ read _ enough _ to _ be _ able _ to _ fill _ out _ the _ answers _ by _ themselves _
uh _
that _ 's _ bad _
it _ 's _ just _ incredible _
yeah _
our _ state _ cut _ a _ whole _ bunch _ of _ a _ i _ think _ it _ 's _ ten _ million _ dollars _ out _ of _ the _ school _ budget _
really _
so _ they _ 're _ making _ all _ kind _ of _ cuts _
in _ college _ people E cannot E i _ mean _ the _ teachers _ ca _ n't _ make _ tests _ any _ more _
and _ the _ library _ canceling _ all _ of _ it _ 's _ subscriptions _
yeah _
it _ 's _ pretty _ sorry _
i _ know _
um _ they _ uh _
i _ forget _
i _ think _ it _ 's _ um _ some _ place _ in _ new _ york _ because _ they _ 're _ having _ budget _ problems _ they _ 're _ closing _ the _ libraries _
uh-huh _
i _ mean _ they _ 're _ not _ getting _ rid _ of _ any _ of _ the _ sports _ or _ anything _ like _ that _
uh _
they _ 're _ not _ cutting _ in _ any _ other _ corner _
they _ 're _ closing _ the _ libraries _
that _ to _ me _ shows _ a _ little _ uh _ switch _ in _ priorities _
yeah _
you _ know _
so _ do _ you _ go _ to _ college _ right _ now _
are _
yeah _
it _ 's _ my _ last _ year _
you E 're E a E so _ you _ 're _ a _ senior _ now _
yeah _
i _ 'm _ working _ on _ my _ projects _ trying _ to _ graduate _
oh _ good _ for _ you _
yeah _
that _ 's _ great _
um E is E is _ n _ c _ university _ is _ that _ uh E state _
n _ c _ state _
what _ did _ you _ say _
n _ c _ state _
n _ c _ state _
that _ 's _ a _ state _ university _ then _
yeah _
i _ see _
and _ you _ 're _ from _ there _ also _
well _ yeah _
i E was E uh E i _ was _ born _ in _
and _ then _ i _ lived _ in _ most _ of _ my _ life _
uh-huh _
i _ see _
and _ now _ i _ 'm _ back _ here _ going _ to _ school _
well E pretty _ soon _ it _ 's _ going _ to _ get _ to _ the _ point _ where _ no _ one _ is _ going _ to _ be _ able _ to _ afford _ to _ send _ their _ kids _ to _ college _ or _ to _ do E go _ to _ college _
yeah _
it _ 's _ just _ a _ outrageously _ expensive _
luckily _ state _ is _ one _ of _ the _ cheap _ ones _
oh _ is _ it _
yeah _
well _ still _ though _
i _ mean _ you _ know _ thousands _ of _ dollars _
yeah _ state _ 's _ not _ that _ bad _
oh _ well _ that _ 's _ good _
yeah _
that _ 's _ good _
i _ went _ to _ a _ private _ university _
and _ um _ i _ do _ n't _ know _
i _ look _ back _ now _
and _ i E i _ think _ that _ i _ probably _ would _ have _ done _ it _ differently _ if _ i _ um E you _ know _ could _ do _ it _ over _ again _
yeah _
but _ um E i _ have _ a _ lot _ of _ friends _ that _ went _ to _ state _ schools _ or _ did _ n't _ even _ go _ to _ school _ some E some _ of _ them _
and _ i _ still _ feel _ like _ they _ came _ out _ knowing _ just _ as _ much _ as _ i _ did _
i _ really _ do _
and _ that _ 's _ probably _ a _ pretty _ sad _ thing _ to _ say _
but _ um _
yeah _
i _ do _ n't _ know _
i E i _
where _ did _ you _ go _
what _
where _ did _ you _ go _
i _ went _ to _ university _
uh-huh _
it _ 's _ in _ massachusetts _
and _ um _ i _ really _ felt _ like _ i _ 've _ been _ working _ now _ for _ about _ four _ years _
uh-huh _
and _ i E i _ feel _ like _ what _ i _ 've _ learned _ working _ is _ a _ hundred _ times _ more _ valuable _ then _ what _ learned _ in _ school _
oh _
and _ i _ know _ that _ i _ 'm _ drawing _ a _ lot _ of _ what _ i _ learned _ in _ school _ you _ know _
i E i _ probably _ just _ subconsciously _ rely _ a _ lot _ on E on _ art _
but _ um _ i _ do _ n't _ know _
my _ sister _ 's _ a _ principal _ at _ a _ school _
and _ one _ thing _ she _ 's _ trying _ to _ instill _ in _ kids _ um E besides _ just _ reading _ and _ writing _ are _ just _ some E the _ golden _ rules _
uh-huh _
she _ calls _ them _ just _ some _ basics _ about _ um _ you _ know _ you _ do _ n't _ take _ what _ 's _ not _ yours _
uh _ and _ if _ you _ want _ to _ you _ know _ you _ do _ n't _ touch _ anybody _ else _ unless _ you _ have _ their _ permission _
like _ no _ hitting _ you _ know _
uh-huh _
no _ pulling _ hair _ or _ anything _ like _ that _
and _ uh E the _ school _ that _ she _ 's _ in _ is E a E um E it _ 's _ basically _ for _ minorities _
um _ there _ 's _ a _ large _ minority _ population _
and _ um _ she _ 's _ really _ noticed _ that _ even _ some _ of _ the _ teachers _ that _ work _ there _
i _ think _ they _ do _ n't _ value _ that _ type _ of _ student _ as _ much _ as _ you _ get _ in _ some _
yeah _
that _ 's _ sorry _
that E they E that _ they _ like E pick _ on _ the _ advanced _ students _ and _ pay _ more _ attention _ to _ them _ ignore _ the _ others _
yeah _
it _ 's _ true _
uh-huh _
yeah _
and _ i _ do _ n't _ know _ if _ it _ makes _ them _ feel _ better _
i _ mean _ the _ do _ teachers _ get _
i _ mean _ personally _ i _ would _ get _ more _ satisfaction _ out _ of _ taking _ someone _ that _ was _ n't _ as _ successful _
yeah _
and _ seeing _ what _ they _ could _ do _ verses _ somebody _ that _ did _ excel _ in E in _ areas _ and _ just _ watching _ them _ get _ better _ you _ know _
yeah _
that _ 's _ not _ much _ of _ a _ challenge _
that _ 's _ true _
but _ do _ you _ have _ any _ ideal _ what _ you _ 're _ going _ into _ when _ you _ graduate _
um _ graduate _ school _
oh _ yeah _
yeah _
do _ you _ know _ where _ you _ 're _ going _
i _ think _ i _ 'm _ going _ to _ chappel _ hill _
where _ 's _ that _
that _ 's _ in _ chappel _ hill _
the _
oh _ is _ that _ north _ carolina _
yeah _
oh _ okay _
never _ heard _ of _ the _ uh _ tarheels _
no _
i _ do _ n't _ know _ that _ area _
the _ a _ c _ c _ tarheels _ u _ n _ c _
i _ know _ it _
oh _ uh _
i _ do _ n't _ get _ down _ there _ very _ often _
they _ won _ the _ final _ four _ in _ boy _ 's _ basket _ ball _
oh _ really _
well _ the _ way _ i _ pick _ the _ final _ four _ was _ um _ by _ the _ state _ that _ had _ the _ warmest _ climate _
uh-huh _
so _ that _ 's _ how _ i _ chose _ all _ mine _
so _ you _ can _ tell _ that _ i _ really _ did _ n't _ have _ that _ much _ to _ do _ with _ any _ of _ it _
but _
so _ obviously _ you _ 're _ into _ education _
yeah _
if _ you _ can _ be _ going _
my _ husband _ went _ to E is _ in _ graduate _ school _ actually _ right _ now _
uh-huh _
and _ uh _
i _ do _ n't _ know _
i _ give _ you _ a _ lot _ of _ credit _
i _ could _ n't _ do _ it _
i E i _ could _ n't _ wait _ to _ graduate _ and _ have _ it _ be _ all _ over _
yeah _
i _ know _
oh _
i _ ca _ n't _ wait _ to _ graduate _ either _ now _
i _ know _
i _ 've _ got _ all _ of _ this _ stuff _ due _
oh _ wow _
overloaded _
yeah _
i _ kind _ of _ know _ what _ you _ mean _
well _ it _ was _ really _ nice _ talking _ to _ you _
all _ right _
okay _
good _ luck _
all _ right _
thank _ you _
all _ righty _
take _ care _
all _ right _
bye _
bye-bye _
okay _
well _ yes _
we _ do _ have _ pollution _ in _ houston _
and _ it _
how _ bad _ is _ it _
do _ you _ have _ smog _ like _ they _ do _ in _ california _
well E it E it _
some _
i _ think _ it _ depends _ on _ uh E you _ know _ what _ the E the _ cloud _ cover _
and _ like E right _ now _ it E 's E uh E it _ 's _ kind _ of _ overcast _ you _ know _
just _ it _ 's _ hot _
uh-huh _
and _ the _ sun _ is E trying E tries _ to _ shine _ through _
but _ it E 's E it _ 's _ holding _ in _ this E this _ pollution _
and _ i _
it _ depends _ on _ whether _ you _ have _ some _ sort _ of _ temperature _ inversion _ i _ take _ it _
i _ think _ so _
and _ uh _
yeah _
and _ we _ have _ uh _ pasadena _ texas _ which _ is _ sort _ of _ between _ here _ an _ you _ know _ heading _ toward _ galveston _
i _ mean _ it E 's E still E part E of E it _ 's _ part _ of _ the _ houston _ metroplex _
uh-huh _
uh-huh _
what _ do _ you _ think _ is _ your _ primary _ cause _ of _ it _
well _ i _ think _ it _ 's _ industry _
and _ i _ think _ it _ 's _ cars _
you _ do _
you _ really _ think _ cars _ contribute _ a _ lot _ now _ that _ they _ 've _ taken _ lead _ out _ of _ gas _
i E do E n't E i _
well _ maybe _ not _
but _ it E it _ sure _ it _ sure _
you _ know _ it _
i E i _ know _ that _ when E i E 'm E when _ i _ 'm _ behind _ a _ car _
and _ uh _ sometimes _ uh _ i _ can _ really _ smell _ especially _ diesel _ and _ things _ like _ that _
uh-huh _
you _ know _ comes _ right _ into _ my _ air _ conditioner _
and _ you _ know _ my _ head _ and _ my _
i _ 'm _ so _ stopped _ up _ right _ now _
um _
my _ goodness _
i _ do _ n't _ know _ if E it E 's E uh E if _ it _ 's _ partly _ from _ what _ 's _ blooming _ you _ know _ right _ now _ pollen _ and _ stuff _ like _ that _
that _ 's _ part _ of _ it _
but _ um _
uh-huh _
i _ think _ a _ lot _ of _ it _ 's _ industrial _
i _ also _ think _ uh _ that _ uh _ there _ is _ a _ certain _ amount _ that _ comes _ from _ automobiles _
but _ it _ 's _ mostly _ from _ older _ automobiles _
i _ do _ n't _ think _ the _ newer _ automobiles _ are _ as _ polluting _ uh _ frankly _
uh-huh _
i E think E that E uh E i _ think _ that _ uh E uh E
if _ uh _
i E i _ i _ heard _ a _ story _ a _ while _ back _
something _ to _ the _ effect _ that _ if _ they _ could _ just _ pay _ to _ get _ twenty _ percent _ or _ take _ all _ the _ cars _ off _ the _ road _ that _ have _ been _ uh _ manufactured _ say _ before _ nineteen _ seventy-five _ that _ they _ could _ cut _ the _ automobile _ pollution _ by _ over _ fifty _ percent _ just _ by _ getting _ rid _ of _ those _ cars _ that _ are _ still _ left _ remaining _
uh-huh _
you _ mean _ uh _ fifty _ percent _ pollution _ total _ from _ that _ comes _ from _
yeah _
from E from _ cars _
that _ is _ not E not _ total _ but _ just _ from _ cars _
okay _
oh _ uh-huh _
so _ that _ i _ think _ would _ be _ tremendous _ help _
but _ i _ happen _ to _ drive _ an _ old _ model _ car _ because _ it _ 's _ very _ economical _
and _ it _ just _ keeps _ getting E uh E gives _ me _ good _ service _
and _ i _ do _ n't _ have _ an _ incentive _ to _ get _ rid _ of _ it _ as _ long _ as _ it _ keeps _ running _ good _ and _ not _ costing _ me _ any _ money _
uh-huh _
on _ the _ other _ hand _ i _ know _ it _ 's _ a _ much _ more _ polluter _ than _ any _ of _ the _ newer _ model _ cars _ i _ have _
uh-huh _
but _ i _ do _ n't _ have _ any _ incentive _ to _ get _ out _ of _ it _ until _ it _ dies _
right _
and _ uh _ that _ may _ be _ part _ of _ the _ problem _
do _ you _ all _ have _ pollution _ in _ your _ part _ of _ the _ country _ uh _ from _ industry _
yeah _ ause _
yeah _
yeah _
oh _ uh _ yeah _
it E 's E it _ 's _ uh E pretty _ heavy _ up _ here _ i _ think _
but _ i _ think _ it _ 's _ mostly _ industrial _ is _ what _ i _ really _ uh E believe _ is _ the E the _ main _ problem _
and E and _ uh E ause _
and _ uh _ uh _ people _ uh _ i _ do _ n't _ think _ are _ paying _ as _ close _ attention _ to _ it _ in _ this _ area _ as _ they _ frankly _ should _
i E i _ we _ we _ seem _ to _ have _ a _ high _ uh E cancer _ rate _ up _ here _ in _ maryland _
really _
yeah _
and _ uh _
like _ what _
any _ particular _ kind _ or _ just _ all _ kinds _
well _ for _ instance _ breast _ cancer _ seems _ to _ be _ pretty _ rampant _
and _ uh _ i _ think _
of _ course _ prostrate _ cancer _ 's _ sort _ of _ bad _ for _ everybody _
but _ uh _ this _ state _ was _ like _ the _ second _
my _ wife _ 's _ a _ registered _ nurse _
and _ i _ think _ this _ state _ was _ like _ second _ this _ year _ from _ the _ top _ in _ terms _ of _ uh _ cancer _ rate _ for _ just _ all _ kinds _
and _ i _ ca _ n't _ help _ but _ believe _ that _ 's _ not _ partially _ caused _ from _ pollution _
i _ just _ do _ n't _ know _ exactly _ what _ it _ necessarily _ is _
but _ i _ just _ ca _ n't _ believe _ it _ is _
um _
now _ we _ have _ a _ lot _ of _ pollution _ being _ caused _ by _ uh _ fluorocarbons _ which _ is _ the _ like _ freon _ twelve _ and _ freon _ twenty-two _
they _ use _ freon _ twenty-two _ in _ air _ conditioning _ systems _ in _ houses _ and _ the _ like _ and _ heat _ pumps _
uh-huh _
and _ they _ use _ freon _ twelve _ in _ car _ air _ conditioners _
and _ that _ 's _ also _ what _ 's _ causing _ our _ atmosphere _ to _ lose _ it _ 's _ ozone _ layer _
uh-huh _
and _ i _ ca _ n't _ help _ believe _ if _ it _ 's _ sufficient _ enough _ to _ make _ the _ atmosphere _ lose _ it _ 's _ ozone _ layer _ that _ it _ 's _ not _ acting _ as _ a _ pollutant _ in _ our _ lungs _ also _
and _ having _ all _ kinds _ of _ effects _
and _
well E what _ can _ we _ do _ about _ the E the _ the _ the _ air _ conditioning _ problem _
well _ they _ 're _ working _ now _
i _ know _ dupont _ and _ dow _ and _ several _ other _ chemical _ companies _ are _ working _ uh _ feverishly _ to _ try _ to _ come _ up _ with _ a _ substitute _ for _ fluorocarbons _
uh-huh _
and _ who _ ever _ does _ is _ going _ to _ make _ uh _ a _ mint _
because _ if _ they _ ever _ come _ up _ with _ a _ reasonable _ working _ agent _ in _ place _ of _ fluorocarbons _ then _ uh _
is _ that _ also _ what _ 's _ in _ uh _ aerosol _
well _ they _ used _ to _ be _
but _ they _ made _ them _ take _ it _ out _ of _ that _
even _ so _ so _ the _ aerosol _ is _ still _ aerosol _
right _
but _ it _ does _ n't _ have _ anything _ that _ 's _ damaging _
no _
they E they _ they _ passed _ a _ law _ and _ made _ them _ take _ the _ fluorocarbons _ out _ of _ the _ aerosol _ containers _
uh-huh _
well _ that _ 's _ good _
and _ that _ was _ a _ move _ in _ the _ right _ direction _
we _ are _ doing _ some _ things _ to _ try _ to _ correct _ the _ problem _
but _ there _ are _ more _ things _ we _ could _ do _
and _ getting _ rid _ of _ old _ cars _ like _ i _ said _ is _ one _ way _ to _ help _ correct _ the _ problem _
uh _ uh _ just _ trying _ to _ i _ think _ be _ careful _ uh _ with _ the _ way _ you _ handle _ garbage _
i _ notice _ in _ this _ state _
i _ do _ n't _ know _ if _ you _ 're _ doing _ it _ in _ texas _ yet _ or _ not _
but _ in _ this _ state _ we E have E special E containers E now _ we _ have _ to _ put _ all _ our _ cans _ and _ bottles _ and _ plastic _ pieces _ uh E you _ know _ containers _ in _
yeah _
here _ they _ 've _ just _ started E started _ doing _ that _
it E 's E it _ 's _ you _ know _
you E 're E not E you _ do _ n't _ have _ to _
but _ you _ know _
i _ know _ i _ am _
i _ save _
yeah _
well _ we _ are _ doing _ it _ pretty _ religiously _ in _ our _ group _ too _
but _ they _ uh _
in _ one _ of _ the _ counties _ here _ they _ 're _ actually _ doing _ a _ trial _ program _ of _ having _ a _ trash _ police _
they _ have _ a _ lady _ that _ goes _ around _ like _ a _ meter _ maid _
and _ she _ spot _ checks _ people _ 's _ trash _
no _ kidding _
really _
oh _
and _ if _ they _ find _ a _ bottle _ or _ a _ can _ or _ anything _ like _ that _ in _ your _ trash _ they _ 'll _ fine _ you _ fifty _ bucks _ i _ think _ the _ first _ time _ and _ two _ fifty _ the _ second _ time _
is _ that _ right _
well _ we _ need _ to _ do _ something _
we _ need _ to _ get _ serious _ about _ it _
yeah _
you _
right _
you _ 've _ got _ to _ get _ people _ to _ see _
and _ surprisingly _ enough _ just _ handling _ of _ trash _ uh E can _ cut _ pollution _ uh E from E uh E uh E from _ just _ throwing _ it _ in _ a _ dump _ or E or _ or _ where _ ever _ else _ they _ used _ to _ do _ with _ it _ maybe _ used _ to _ burn _ it _
they _ 've _ stopped _ that _ up _ here _ too _
uh-huh _
but _ that E that _ will _ cut _ pollution _ too _
because _ you _ get _ a _ lot _ of _ out _ gassing _ from _ these _ things _ i _ think _ decaying _ and E and _ trying _ to _
for _ instance _ cans _ and _ bottles _ they _ never _ go _ away _ at _ all _
uh-huh _
but _ on E on _ the _ other _ hand _ i _ do _ n't _ guess _ they _ 're _ polluting _
but _ plastic _ containers _ and _ the E like E uh E they _ may _ be _
i _ 'm _ not _ sure _ of _ that _
how _ much _ does _ uh _ planting _ more _ trees _ and _ things _ like _ that _ help _
oh _ i _ think _ that _ 's _ very _ important _ to _ do _
too _
i E i _ really _ think _ that _ uh E trying _ to _ get _ along _ with _ your _ environment _ and _ help _ it _ out _ is _ a _ very _ very _ important _ thing _
uh-huh _
and _ uh _ that _ can _ help _ to _ cut _ pollution _ i _ guess _ some _
i E i _ do _ n't _ know _ how _ much _ trees _ actually _ act _ as _ filtering _ agents _ in _ terms _ of _ pulling _ various _ pollutants _ or _ chemicals _ out _ of _ the _ air _
i _ would _ hope _ that _ they _ would _ help _ some _ though _
that _ 's _ for _ sure _
i _ think _ uh _ it _ seems _ like _ there _ was _ something _ going _ on _ around _ here _ that _ you _ know _
we _ have _ all _ these _ chemical _ plants _ and _ oil _ refineries _ and _ those _ kind _ of _ things _ and _ that _ they _ burn _ off _ a _ lot _ of _ stuff _
uh-huh _
and _ some _ of _ the _ stuff _ that _ they _ were _ n't _ supposed _ to _ do _ that _ somebody _ found _ out _ you _ know _ like _ in _ the _ middle _ of _ the _ night _ they _ would _ go _ ahead _ and _ do _ it _ anyway _
i _ think _ they _ got _ caught _
oh _ good _
but _ i _ wonder _ how _ much _ of _ that _ kind _ of _ stuff _ you _ know _ goes _ on _
well E that E uh E that _ i _ think _ may _ go _ on _ a _ lot _
and _ the _ primary _ reason _ i _ think _ it _ may _ go _ on _ a _ lot _ is _ just _ as _ you _ said _ somebody _ happened _ to _ stay _ up _ late _ at _ night _ or _ something _
i _ do _ n't _ think _ we _ have _ a _ adequate _ policing _ uh _ particularly _ on _ industry _
uh E we _ have _ good _ policing _ at _ least _ in _ this _ state _ and E and _ several _ of _ the _ surrounding _ states _ and _ probably _ yours _ too _ of _ car _ pollutants _
because _ we _ have _ to _ go _ down _ uh _ once _ a _ year _ here _ in _ maryland _ and _ get _ out _ car _ 's _ exhaust _ systems _ checked _ for _ emission _ content _
uh E we E have E to E uh E we _ have _ to _ have _ a _ state _ inspection _ every _ year _
uh-huh _
do _ you _ all _ have _ that _
uh _ no _
we _ do _ n't _ have _ a _ state _ inspection _
so _
which _ i _
i _
i _ would _
but _ any _ time _ you _ sell _ a _ car _ or _ buy _ a _ car _ it _ has _ to _ be _ inspected _ in _ this _ state _
so _ i E 'm E i _ 'm _ assuming _ that _ you _ know _ they E check E they _ check _ everything _ for _ safety _
or _
i _ do _ n't _ know _
uh _ that _ 's _ something _ that _ you _ 'd _ have _ to _ just _ check _ with _ your _ authorities _
but _ in _ this _ state _ we _ have _ to _ uh E pay _ eight _ dollars _ and _ a _ half _ and _ go _ to _ a E an _ emission _ station _ once _ a _ year _ and _ get _ every _ one _ of _ our _ cars _ checked _ that _ are E have _ been _ made _ starting _ in _ nineteen _ seventy-three _
but _ that _ 's _ all _ they _ check _ for _
they _ do _ n't _ check _ how _ good _
if _ your _ tires _ are _ good _ enough _ or _ your _ brakes _ are _ good _ enough _
no _
no _
we _ do _ n't _ have _ inspections _ like _ that _
now _ i _ 'm _ in _ maryland _
in _ virginia _ they _ check _ that _ every _ two _ years _ i _ think _
we _ do _ that _ every _ year _
and _ i _ think _ that _ 's _ a _ good _ idea _ too _
not E not _ that _ it _ necessarily _ has _ anything _ to _ do _ with _ cutting _ pollution _ necessarily _
but _ i _ think _ it _ 's _ a _ good _ idea _
the _ emission _ check _ though _ is _ required _ in _ maryland _
and _ it _ 's _ also _ required _ in _ virginia _ uh E a _ sister _ state _ to E to _ this _ one _
and _ that E 's E that _ goes _ a _ long _ ways _ towards _ cutting _ pollutants _
well _ i _ 'll _ have _ to _ check _
i _ 'm _ not _ sure _ if E if _ our _ state _ inspection _
once _ a _ year _ has _ to _ do _ you _ know _
if _ they _ check _ the _ uh _
uh-huh _
well E if _ they _ do _ n't _ i _ would _ imagine _ in _ time _ they _ 'll _ get E a E law E with E get _ around _ to _ it _
and _ if _ they _ do _ n't _ then _ that _ 's _ something _ i _ would _ certainly _ uh _ uh _ suggest _ you _ be _ willing _ to _ uh _ uh _ be _ for _ in _ terms _ of _ uh _
oh _ i _ would _
yeah _
yeah _
i _ 'm _ for _ anything _ that _ cleans _ up _ the _ air _ or _ the _ water _ or E or _ or _ anything _
oh _ yeah _
i E i _ agree _
now _ that _ 's _ another _ area _ we _ have _ n't _ even _ discussed _
and _ that _ is _ water _ pollution _ and _ various _ of _ the _ other _ types _ of E uh E of _ uh E like E food _ pollution _
i _ mean _ you E you _ hardly _ ever _ hear E hear _ anybody _ say _ anything _ about _ food _ pollution _
but _ i _ think _ there E we _ have _ a _ pretty _ good _ handle _ on _ inspection _ of _ foods _ in _ this _ countries _
so _ uh _ hopefully _ we _ 're _ not _ ingesting _ too _ much _ in _ the _ way _ of _ uh _ pollutants _ in _ our _ food _
but _ water _ pollution _ uh _
i _ 've _ worried _ especially _ the _ last _ few _ years _ about _ just _ how _ good _ the _ water _ supply _ we _ have _ in _ this _ country _ is _ for _ drinking _ and _ the _ like _
uh-huh _
i _ know _ a _ lot _ more _ people _ are _ going _ to _ bottled _ water _
well _
and _ that _ 's _ not _ necessarily _ the _ answer _ either _
because _ they _ 've _ found _ out _ that _ that _ 's _ just _ comes _ out _ of _ somebody _ 's _ tap _
yeah _
tap _
yeah _
so _
but _ a _ lot _ of _ these _ uh _
some _ of _ this _
well _ you _ know _ a _ lot _ of _ people _ have _ well _ water _
in _ fact _ in _ this _ area _ too _
and _ an _ you _ know _
and _ uh _
uh-huh _
if _ you _ do _ n't _ get _ it _ tested _ you _ do _ n't _ necessarily _ know _ what E you E 're E what _ you _ 're _ drinking _
and _ i E i _ know _ a _ lot _ of _ people _ you _ know _ have _ that _
and _ you _ know _ you _ have _ to _ wonder _ if _ that _ you _ know _ could _ have _ an _ adverse _ affect _ on _ them _ too _ if _ they E do E n't E they _ do _ n't _ get _ it _ checked _
yeah _
yeah _
i _ 'm _ absolutely _ for _ drinking _ water _ out _ of _ wells _ as _ long _ as _ you _ first _ of _ course _ have _ it _ checked _
because _ it _ seems _ uh _
when _ i _ was _ a _ kid _ growing _ up _ down _ south _ uh _ i _ used _ to _ go _ out _ in _ the _ country _ where _ my _ grandparents _ were _
and _ we _ had _ a _ well _
it _ was _ one _ of _ those _ draws _ that _
i _ forget _ what _ you _ call _ those _ things _
uh-huh _
and E and _ that _ was _ some _ of _ the _ best _ tasting _ water _
i _ mean _ i _ can _ still _ to _ this _ day _ taste _ that _ water _
when _ we _ were _
when _ i _ was _ growing _ up _ i _ lived _ in _ huntsville _ alabama _
yeah _
and _ their _ water _ supply _ came _ from _ uh _ spring _
uh-huh _
and _ it _ was _ like _ ice E cold _ spring _ water _
and _ i _ guess _ parts _ of _ the E the _ city _ still _ you _ know _ get _ that _
but _ uh E that E was E that _ was _ really _ wonderful _
oh _ i _ bet _ it _ was _
it _ was _ really _ really _ good _
yeah _
once E it E 's E been E filtered E an E if _ it _ 's _ a _ deep _ enough _ well _ filtered _ through _ all _ the _ earth _ and _ everything _ i _ think _ that _ uh E
it _ depends _ of _ course _ where _ you _ are _
a E good E well E though _ i _ think _ is _ very _ healthy _
the _ latin _ american _ situation _ in _
the _ last _ development _ i _ know _ of _ was _ the _ military _ and _ financial _ assistance _ columbia _ for E the E for _ the _ drug _ uh E control _
uh-huh _
and _ i _ support _ that _ fully _
i _ 'm _ not _ sure _ we _ have _ the _ right _ solution _ to _ it _
but _ at _ least _ we E 're E we _ 're _ going _ to _ the _ source _ of _ the _ problem _
and _ the _ source _ of _ supply _
uh-huh _
uh _ the _ problem _ is _ here _
but _ the _ source _ of _ supply _ is _ there _
that _ 's _ true _
very _ definitely _ so _
in _ fact _ i _ think _ a _ lot _ of _ the _
i _ 've _ been _ to _ uh _ peru _ several _ times _
uh-huh _
i _ 've _ never _ been _ to _ other _ parts _ of _ south _ america _
but _ uh _ i _ have _ been _ to _ peru _
and _ they _ need _ some _ assistance _ down _ there _
and _ i _ 'm _ sure _ that _ uh E as _ an _ undeveloped _ country _ they _ look E look _ for _ it _
no _
very _ immature _ in _ that _ respect _
yes _
right _
and _ i E i _ think _ that _ uh E they _ need _ guidance _ and _ assistance _
but _ they _ need _ to _ learn _ how _ to _ stand _ on _ their _ own E own _ two _ feet _ also _
i _ agree _
i _ think _ that _ for _ so _ long _ power _ financially _ uh E governmentally _ every _ which _ way _ was _ in _ the _ hands _ of _ such _ a _ few _ that _ there _ 's _ not _ the _ middle _ class _ that _ we E we _ perceive _
uh-huh _
oh _ no _ the _ and _ the _ poor _ are _ extremely _ poor _
i _ know _
are _ extremely _ poor _
that _ 's _ correct _
i _ know _ uh E some _ of _ the _ areas _ in E in _ texas _ seem _ poor _
but _ until _ you _ 've _ seen _ some _ of _ those _ uh _ native _ latin _ americans _ come _ down _ from _ the _ hills _ you _ ca _ n't _ imagine _ what _ poor _ is _
uh-huh _
and _ uh E the _ worst _ scene _ i _ 've _ ever _ had _ i _ think _ was _ uh E someone _ eating _ out E of E out _ of _ a _ garbage _ can _ on _ the _ streets _ in _ lima _ peru _
and E and _ just _ very _ happy _ to _ get _ that _
oh _ yes _
yes _
i _ have _ a _ brother _ who _ spent _ two _ years _ in _ bolivia _
uh-huh _
and _ this _ is _ very _ much _ his _ you _ know _ reaction _ that _ the _ rich _ are _ so _ rich _ and _ the _ poor _ are _ so _ poor _
oh E the E there _ 's _ a _ joke _
the E the _ graft _ and _ the _ uh E payoffs _ down _ there _ are E are _ an _ accepted _ way _
and _ in _ a _ way _
uh-huh _
uh-huh _
and _ there E 's E there _ 's _ a _ sad _ joke _
i _ guess _ all _ jokes _ are _ really _ sad _
but _ there _ 's _ a _ joke _ about _ the _ uh _ ambassador _ from _ latin _ america _ that _ came _ to _ visit _ a _ senator _ in _ the _ u _ s _ and _ was _ taken _ to _ his _ home _ for _ dinner _
and _ the _ uh _ home _ was _ palatial _
they _ had _ five _ or _ six _ servants _ you _ know _ and E and _ a _ lot _ of _ expensive _ uh E holdings _ and _ all _ that _
and _ the _ ambassador _ said _ but _ i _ know _ what _ you _ make _ as _ a _ u _ s _ senator _
how _ can _ you _ afford _ all _ of _ this _
and _ he _ said _ come _ i _ 'll _ show _ you _
and _ he _ walked _ out _ in _ the _ backyard _
and _ the _ uh _ senator _ said _ do _ you _ see _ that _ hospital _ over _ there _
and _ the _ ambassador _ said _ yes _
and _ he _ patted _ his _ pocket _
and _ he _ said _ fifteen _ percent _
he _ said _ you _ see _ that _ school _ over _ there _
and _ the _ ambassador _ said _ yes _
and _ he _ pot _ patted _ his _ pocket _ and _ said _ fifteen _ percent _
so _
oh _ gosh _
so _ the _ next _ year _ the _ senator _ went _ to _ latin _ america _ to _ visit _ the _ ambassador _ and _ was _ treated _ to _ dinner _ in _ his _ home _
and _ it _ was _ twice _ as _ large _ and _ four _ times _ as _ many _ servants _
he _ said _ well _ i _ know _ how _ poor _ your _ country _ is _
how _ can _ you _ afford _ this _ uh _ in _ such _ a _ poor _ country _
and _ he E he _ said _ come _ i _ 'll _ show _ you _
and _ he _ walked _ out _ the _ backyard _
and _ he _ said _ do _ you _ see _ that _ hospital _ over _ there _
and _ the _ senator _ looked _
and _ he _ could _ n't _ see _ anything _
he _ said _ no _
and _ the _ ambassador _ potted E patted _ his _ pocket _ and _ said _ one _ hundred _ percent _
so _
yep _
yeah _
that _
it _ 's _ a _ sad _ story _
but _
intentions _ intentions _
yes _
yes _
but _ it E uh E it _ is _ a _ problem _
i _ know _
uh _ i _ have _ a _ sister-in-law _ who _ is _ from _ nicaragua _
and _ her _ family _
her _ father _ was _ a _ fairly _ uh _ high _ ranking _ official _ under _ somoza _
and _ when _ that _ went _ down _ the _ tubes _ they _ had _ to _ get _ out _
uh-huh _
and _ seventeen _ children _ filtered _ through E into _ into _ america _ through _ guatamala _ through _ mexico _ through _ honduras _
um _
you _ know _ two E here E three _ there _ one _ here _ you _ know _ this _ kind _ of _ thing _ until _
yeah _
and _ now _ uh _ couple _ of _ the _ older _ ones _ stayed _ or _ went _ back _
but _ the _ rest _ of _ them _ now _ have _ their _ american _ citizenship _ and _ are _ leading _ productive _ lives _
uh-huh _
but _ you _
well E the E the _ other _ instance _ i _ think _ of _ their _ inability _ to E to _ handle _ things _ the _ cholera _ and _ hepatitis _ epidemics _ now _ in E in _ latin _ america _
yes _
and _ it _ shows _ the E the _ unpreparedness _ for _ such _ such _ a _ problem _
yes _
and _ yet _ they _ 're _ so _
oh E the _ stories _ she _ tells _ you _ know _ are _ just E unnerving E just _ unnerving _
yeah _
and _ they E 're E they _ 're _ so _ rich _ in _ resources _ there _
they _ 're _ very _ rich _ in _ oil _ and _ gas _
and _ they _ 're _ very _ rich _ in _ gold _ and _ silver _ and _ very _ rich _ in E in _ uh E natural _ resources _ such _ as _ the _ fish _ and _ uh E timber _ and E and _ copper _ and _ all _ types _ of _ uh E resources _
uh-huh _
uh-huh _
but _ they _
and _ the _ uranium _
yes _
and _
but _ they _ do _ n't _ have _
it _ 's _ sort _ of _ like _ russia _
they _ do _ n't _ have _ the _ ability _ to _ develop _ it _
the _ technology _
right _
and _ they E they _ 're _ very _
well _
and _ you _ know _ they _ 're _ very _ willing _ to _ be _ taught _ in _ many _ cases _ now _ too _
but _ you _ know _ there _ 's _ just _ always _ this _ kind _ of _ resentment _ underlying _
i _ think _ that _ when _ they _ receive _ help _ from _ us _ they _ want _ it _
but _ they _ do _ n't _ want _ it _ i _ mean _
you E 're E you _ 're _ exactly _ right _
it _ 's _ kind _ of _ a _ catch _ twenty-two _
uh-huh _
it E it _ 's _ sort _ of _ illustrated _ by _ the _ uh E world _ bank _ and _ international _ monetary _ fund _ not _ wanting _ to _ continue _ to _ do _ business _ there _
because _ they _ offer _ assistance _ then _ do _ n't _ get _ repaid _
yeah _
yeah _
so _ it _ 's _ sort _ of _ a _ thumbing _ of _ the _ nose _ uh _ approach _
they _ need _ it _
and _ they _ need _ to _ live _ up _ to _ certain _ regulations _ and _ expectations _
but _ uh _ then _ do _ n't _
of _ course _ it _ 's _ a _ very _ volatile _ government _ uh _ situation _ too _
well _
and _ i _ think _ that _ you _ know _ it _
somewhat _ a _ sarcastic _ view _
but _ some _ of _ those _ drugs _ czars _ you _ know _
they E they _ know _ that _ by _ pumping _ that _ poison _ into _ our _ system _ that E that _ 's _ the _ way _ to _ bring _ us _ to _ our _ knees _ more _ on _ their _ level _
uh-huh _
you _ know _
you _ know _ that _ 's _ really _ uh _ kind _ of _ a _ far _ fetched _ idea _
i _ know _
and _ i _ do _ n't _ think _ people _ probably _ think _ those _ things _ consciously _
uh-huh _
but _ it _ 's _ like _ in _ any _ sibling _ rivalry _
well _ the _
we _ 're _ hearing _ the _ same _
the _ solution _ discussed _ at _ one _ time _ and _ i _ think _ it _ has _ real _ merit _ on _ the _ drug _ situation _ is _ that _ the E the _ u _ s _ government _ could _ spend _ less _ money _ by _ buying _ the _ crop _ and _ destroying _ it _ than _ they _ are _ in _ trying _ to E to _ beef _ up _ the _ military _ and _ to _ do _ all _ other _ things _
i _ think _ it _ would _ be _ cheaper _ to _ buy _ it _ and _ destroy _ it _
which _ would _ still _ give _ the E uh E the _ grower _ in _ columbia _ and _ elsewhere _ in _ latin _ america _ the E uh E the _ money _ that _ they _ apparently _ need _ and _ go E go _ to _ the _ illegal _ crop _ for _
and _ it _ would _ save _ the _ u _ s _ money _ in E in _ the _ long _ run _ in _ how _ much _ they _ 're _ trying _ to _ do _
in _ the _ long _ run _
and _ in _ the _ short _ run _ probably _ too _
true _
course _ then _ could E you _ know _ at E at _ some _ point _ could _ you _ ever _ convince _ someone _ to _ turn _ around _ and _ grow _ something _ that _ was _ productive _ for _ humankind _
no _
no _
you _ know _
and _ i E i _ think _ finding _ an _ alternate _ to _ that _ would _ be _ very _ good _
i _ mean _ even E their E even _ their _ legal _ crops _ are _ things _ that _ we _ do _ n't _ perceive _ as _ being _ healthy _ now _ from _ a _ medical _ standpoint _ of _ view _ coffee _ tobacco _ you _ know _
right _
uh-huh _
argentine _ beef _
yeah _
yeah _
they _ 're _ certainly _ legal _
but _ they _ 're _ certainly _ not _ healthy _
well _ have _ we _ come _ up _ with _ a _ solution _ yet _ salina _
no _
not _ that _ i _ know _ of _
but _ it _ 's _ been _ fun _ hashing _ about _ it _ i _ suppose _
at _ any _ rate _
yeah _
yeah _
yeah _
well E one _ of _ these _ days _ uh E i _ hope _ we _ 'll _ find _ some E some _ way _ to _ substitute _ the _ good _ crops _ for _ illegal _ ones _
well E let _ 's _ just _ hope _ that _ the _ powers _ that _ be E uh E have _ time _ to _ a _ little _ bit _ once _ in _ a _ while _ to E to _ think _ in _ some _ farther _ reaching _ avenues _ than _ you _ and _ i _ do _ here _ tonight _
but _
i _ agree _
well _ it _ 's _ been _ nice _ chatting _ with _ you _
yes _
it _ has _
i _ appreciate _ it _
and E and _ tell _ your _ wife _ i _ hope _ we E i _ get _ her _ again _ sometime _ too _
this _ is _ fun _
very _ good _
it _ 's _ kind _ of _ nice _ to E to _ see _ old _ friends _ now _ you _ see _
all _ right _
thank _ you _ salina _
bye _ now _
bye _
gun _ control _ seems _ to _ be _ a _ rather _ uh _ timely _ topic _ with _ all _ that _ 's _ going _ on _ legislation _ wise _
yes _
and _ uh E the E the _ interesting _ scale _ that _ they _ assigned _ it _ uh E the _ one _ being _ a _ banned _ and _ ten _ being _ no _ regulations _ or _ totally _ free _
i _ 'd _ have _ to _ put _ myself _ pretty _ much _ in _ the _ middle _ i _ guess _
i E i _ do _ n't _ mind _ regulating _ all _ of _ the E the _ guns _
and _ i _ would _ certainly _ call _ for _ a _ ban _ on _ certain _ types _
now E the E the _ wisdom _ as _ to _ which _ types _ that _ 's _ going _ to _ be _ a _ debate _ forever _ i _ would _ assume _
uh E the _ method _ of E of _ controlling _ it _ well E that _ 's _ all _ into _ how _ much _ money _ you _ want _ to _ put _ into _ the E the _ controls _
uh _ one _ point _ that _ was _ made _ in _ the _ house _ hearings _
or _
the _ representative _ stood _ up _ and _ said _ you _ know _ we _ can _ check _ a _ guy _ 's _ credit _ card _ instantly _
but _ uh _ we _ do _ n't _ want _ to _ check _ his _ background _
and _ of _ course _ those _ are _ two _ different _ issues _ as _ far _ as _ privacy _ goes _
right _
uh _
but _ there E still E the _ the _ technology _ exists _ to E to _ check _ it _ if _ they _ want _
so _ it E 's E it _ 's _ kind _ of _ a _
i _ guess _ you _ could _ put _ a _ dollar _ figure _ on _ it _ if _ you _ really _ want _ to _ make _ that _ kind _ of _ an _ effort _ and _ regulate _ it _ like _ that _
and _ then _ you _ 've _ got _ the _ group _ of _ people _ that _ decide _ that _ there E 's E there _ 's _ no _ particular _ reason _ to _ have _ them _ at _ all _
and _ you _ got _ to _ balance _ those _ against _ the _ ones _ that _ say _ there _ is _ some _ sport _ to _ it _
and _ i _ guess _ i _ would _ fall _ more _ in _ the E the _ realm _ that _ i _ like _ the _ sport _ issue _ of _ it _
but _ i E i _ could _ give _ it _ up _ without _ too _ much _ trouble _
not _ the _ world _ 's _ most _ pleasurable _ thing _
and _ it _ costs _ a _ bit _ to _ do _ it _ uh _ finding _ ranges _ and _ things _ like _ that _
yes _
right _
uh _ i _ have _ shot _ a _ variety _ of _ guns _ for _ a _ number _ of _ years _
but _ it _ 's _ just _ not _ like _ golf _ or _ whatever _
i _ mean _ there _ are _ other _ things _ that _ you _ could _ go _ do _
so _ uh E i E i _ do _ n't _ see _ the E the _ joy _ of _ shooting _ as E as _ that _ much _ of _ a _ driving _ factor _
i _ think _ that _ society _ could _ easily _ swing _ the _ scales _ the _ other _ direction _ just _ for _ the _ sake _ of _ safety _ of _ the _ number _ of _ kids _ that _ tend _ to _ get _ hurt _
yeah _
i _ do _ n't _ even _ keep _ the _ gun _ in _ our _ house _
right _
so _ i _ do _ n't _ have _ that _ problem _
but _ uh _
it _ 's _ a _ hard E hard _ topic _ i _ guess _
a _ lot _ of _ people _ have _ a _ hard _ issue _ a _ lot _ of _ hard _ feelings _ about _ it _
they _ do _
and _ you E boy E you _ can _ get _ them _ on _ either _ side _
and _ just _ like _ you _ say _
uh E well E i E think E i E i _ guess _ i _ 'd _ have _ to _ place _ myself _ uh E probably _ seven _ or _ eight _
because _
or _ not _
onto _ no _ control _
i _ 'm _ sorry _ excuse _ me _ that _
uh _ two _ or _ three _
uh-huh _
i _ was _ going _ the _ wrong _ direction _
uh _ because _ of _ we _ had _ a _ neighbor _ child _ that _ was _ killed _ by _ another _ child _ because _ they _ had _ a _ gun _ in _ the _ house _
and _ the _ father _ kept _ the _ bullets _ in _ a _ separate _ place _
but _ the _ little _ boy _ was _ five _ years _ old _ and _ was _ intelligent _ enough _ to _
uh _ he _ knew _ where _ booth _ both _ places _ were _ loaded _ the _ gun _
and _ they _ were _ playing _ cowboys _ and _ indians _
and _ he _ shot _ the _ other _ little _ boy _ right _ between _ the _ eyes _
so _ uh _
i _ mean _ it _
it _ destroyed _ two _ families _ uh _ in _ just _ that _ instant _
right _
and E and _ i E a _ lot _ of _ people _ say _ that _ they _ need _ it _ for _ protection _ uh E
having _ worked _ at _ one _ time _ in _ baltimore _
or _
i _ do _ n't _ know _ if _ you _ 're _ in _ the _ big _ city _
dallas _
are _ you _
dallas _
uh-huh _
that _ 's _ a _ big _ city _
yeah _
uh _ then _ you _ know _ that _ uh _ uh _
if _ you _ live _ anywhere _ real _ close _ that _ uh _
the _ safety _ is _ uh _
some _ people _ argue _ that _ they _ need _ a _ gun _ to _ make _ sure _ that _ they _ are _ n't _ going _ to _ get _ shot _ because _ of _ the _ incidences _ of _ break _ ins _ and _ you _ know _
but _ uh _ uh _ we _ have _ never _ had _ a _ gun _ in _ the _ house _ with _ my _ children _ growing _ up _
uh _ i _ uh _
once _ uh E uh E knew _ a _ fellow _ that _ had E had _ been _ a _ policeman _
and _ he _ said _ that _ if _ you _ pull _ a _ gun _ on _ a _ robber _ he _ 's _ going _ to _ assume _ that _ you _ know _ how _ to _ use _ it _ well _
and _ he _ 's _ going _ to _ you _ know _ try _ to _ shoot _ first _
right _
uh _ so _ you _ know _ if _ he _ 's _ got _ one _
uh _ and _ if _ not _
uh _ then _ usually _ they _ uh _
if _ he _ 's _ got _ a _ knife _ or _ whatever _ that _ can _ throw _ it _ at _ you _
i _ mean _ you _ know _ they E they _
right _
he _ said _ that _ it E it _ was _ better _ not _ to _ have _
especially _ myself _ now _ i _ 'm _ a _ widow _
and _ uh _
i E so _ i E 'm E when _ my _ handicapped _ son _ is E is _ not _ at _ home _ i _ 'm _ by _ myself _
but _ uh _ there _ 's _
i _ still _ wo _ n't _ have _ a _ gun _ in _ the _ house _ because _ he _ said _ it _ 's _ really _ uh _ playing _ russian _ roulette _ if _ you _ do _
uh _
yeah _
about _ the _ only _ circumstances _ that _ they _ 'd _ be _ of _ any _ value _ is _ when _ you _ happen _ to _ already _ know _ that _ the E the _ person _ was _ coming _ your _ way _
once _ you _ 're _ surprised _ it _ 's _ too _ late _
that _ 's _ right _
and E and _ the _ rare _
that _ 's _ right _
you _ know _ the _ very _ few _ of _ those _ burglaries _ actually _ occur _ in _ such _ a _ way _ that _ you _ knew _ the _ guy _ was _ coming _
right _
and _ had _ time _ to _ do _ anything _ about _ it _
that _ 's _ right _
and _ i _ do _ n't _ have _ that _ problem _
as _ i _ do _ n't _ use _ that _ argument _ as _ saying _ it _ 's _ worth _ keeping _ one _
in _ the _ uh E n _ r _ as _ uh E claim _ that _ the E uh E the _ constitutional _ the _ right _ to _ bear _ arms _ and _ that _ whole _ statement _ uh E
it _ 's _ hard _ to _ know _ the _ original _ intent _
but _ i E i _ do _ n't _ see _ it _ as _ that E that _ difficult _ of _ a _ story _ to _ believe _ when _ the _ opposition _ says _ that _ uh E yeah E it _ 's _ the _ right _ to E to _ arm _ a _ militia _ and E as _ opposed _ to _ just _ the _ general _ public _
right _
and _ you E have E a E you _ have _ a E earn _ a _ right _
not _ just _ a _ privilege _ as _ it _ were _ if _ you _ 're _ going _ to _ serve _ in _ the _ militia _
then _ you _ have _ a _ right _ to _ have _ that _ arm _
but _ uh _
that _ 's _ right _
you _ know _ there _ 's _ all _ sorts _ of _ arguments _ there _
i _ know _
but _ i _ do _ n't _ even _ want _ to _ worry _ about _ what _ the _ original _ intent _ was _
no _
they _ did _ n't _ have _ this _ problem _ back _ then _
no _
that _ 's _ true _
that E that _ 's _ that _ 's _ right _
so _ we _ change _ our _ rights _ with _ our _ social _ status _
that _ 's _ right _
they _ 're _ man _ given _ rights _
and _ they _ can _ be _ taken _ away _ by _ a _ man _
so _
right _
uh _ the _ people _ that _ hide _ behind _ that _ i _ do _ n't _ worry _ about _
they _ can _ go _ live _ in _ another _ country _ if _ they _ want _
well _ yeah _
that _ 's _ how _ i _ feel _ too _
i _ know _ well _
even _ here _ where _ i _ work _ uh E we _ have _ a E a _ gun _ club _
and _ of _ course _ those _ people _ are _ very _ avid _
they E you _ know _ they _ say _ there _ should _ be _ no _ ban _
uh-huh _
that _ it _ 's _ not _
but _ i _ ca _ n't _ see _ why _ any _ uh _ on _ the _ street _ citizen _ should _ be _ able _ to _ be _ allowed _ to _ have _ a _ machine _ gun _
right _
uh _ you _ know _ when _ you _ were _ talking _ about _ maybe _ what _ kind _ of _ guns _ that _ would _ be _ hard _ to _ decide _
but _ there _ are _ a _ few _ guns _ that _ uh _ just _ are _ not _ uh _ sport _
or _ i _ mean _
i _ do _ n't _ know _ too _ many _ people _ that _ use _ a _ machine _ gun _ to _ go _ sport _ hunting _ either _
right _
so _ uh E i E i _ think _ they _ should _ have _ at _ least _ some _ control _ over E over _ those _ things _
uh _ and _ when _ you _ were _ speaking _ about _ how _ they _ can _ check _ up _ you _ know _ on _ credit _ cards _
well E i E i _ understand _ about _ the _ privacy _ act _ and _ everything _
but _ why _ ca _ n't _ they _ check _ to _ see _ if _ the _ person _ who _ is _ applying _ for _ this _ gun _ has _ had _ a _ record _ or _ not _
that _ to _ me _ would _ not _ be _ an _ unreasonable _ thing _
right _
and _ if _ they _ do _
course _ the _ argument _ with _ the _ people _ in _ the _ gun _ club _ uh _ is _ that _ uh _ well _ the _ people _ that _ are _ going _ to _ get _ guns _ are _ the _ ones _ that _ are _ going _ to _ steal _ them _ anyway _
right _
and _ so _ it _ 's _ not _ going _ to _ be _ that _ they _ 're _ buying _ them _
course _ some _ of _ them _ do _
yeah _
so _ it E it _ is _ a _ hard _ question _
tends E to E tends _ to _ strap _ only _ the _ legitimate _ people _
most _ regulation _ does _
right _
oh _ yeah _
and _ most _
it _ 's _ very _ difficult _ to _ uh _ legislate _ uh _ crooks _ or _ whatever _ you _ want _ however _ you _ want _ to _ word _ it _
that _ 's _ right _
so _ it _ 's _
well _ this _ may _ be _ a _ never _ ending _ topic _
i _ got _ a _ couple _ of _ calls _ waiting _ on _ me _
so _ i _ 'd _ better _ let _ you _ go _
okay _
well _ thanks _ for _ talking _
okay _ bye _
bye-bye _ now _
night _
fine _
thank _ you _
i _ understand _ we _ 're _ supposed _ to _ talk _ about _ spaceflight _
yes _
i _ hope _ you _ know _ more _ about _ it _ than _ i _ do _
oh _ well _ i _ just _ got _ through _ renting _ reading _ uh _ space _ by _ uh _ james _ michener _
oh _ is _ that _ right _
and _ so _ that _ uh _ helped _ out _ a _ little _ bit _ i _ think _
i _ have _ n't _ read _ his _ book _
i _ was _ so _ upset _ with _ texas _ that _ i _ have _ n't _ gotten _ into _ any _ more _ of _ his _ books _ because _ i _ thought _ it _ was _ just _ horrible _
well _ he _ tends _ to _ go _ into _ a _ lot _ of _ detail _ sometimes _
well _
and _ i _ do _ n't _ think _ he _ was _ truthful _ in _ a _ lot _ of _ what _ he _ did _ in _ texas _
so _ i _ was _ n't _ sure _ how _ credible _ he _ was _
oh _ is _ that _ right _
but _ anyway _ what _ do _ you _ think _ we _ 've _ gained _ from _ the _ spaceflights _
well _ uh _ i _ 'm _ not _ sure _ to _ be _ honest _ with _ you _
so _ uh E this E going _ to _ the _ moon _ seemed _ to _ be _ a _ exciting _ adventure _
and E uh E and _ yeah E
ego _ trip _
it _ was _ nice _ to _ go _ there _
but _ i _ do _ n't _ know _ that _ it _ really _ benefitted _ mankind _ that _ much _
uh-huh _
i _ happen _ to _ live _ not _ too _ far _ away _ from _
uh _ well _ i _ 've _ actually _ worked _ for _ the _ company _ that _ uh _ has _ been _ blamed _ for _ the _ challenger _ disaster _ uh _ morton _ thiakol _
oh _ is _ that _ right _
uh-huh _
and _ uh E you _ know _ that _ 's _ been _ kind _ of _ a E a _ real _ negative _ feeling _ here _
is _
right _
sure _ it _ was _ you _ know _ very _ unfortunate _ thing _ that _ occurred _ there _
and _ it _ 's _
where _ do _ you _ live _
uh _ we _ live _ in _ uh _ utah _
you _ live _ in _
am _ i _ talking _ to _ utah _ right _ now _
uh-huh _
oh _ oh _ great _
yeah _
because _ i _ 'm _ in _ dallas _
uh _
oh _
i _ have _ a _ sister _ that _ lives _ in _ dallas _
that _ 's _ how _ we _ got _ hooked _ up _ to _ the _ program _ was _ her E her _ husband _ works _ for _ penney _ 's _ there _
i _ see _
i _ see _
so _
carolyn _ rash _
pardon _ me _
is _ her _ name _ rash E carolyn _ rash _
no E her E name E is E uh E my _ last _ name _ is _ skidmore _
i _ see _
and _ her E her _ husband _ 's _ name _ is _ his _ last _ name _ is _ weight _
i _ see _
and _ uh _
well _ you _ probably _ know _ a _ lot _ about _ it _
i _ was _ n't _ sure _ that _ they _ were _ blaming _ that _ space _ disaster _ on _ one _ company _
i _ had _ n't _ heard _ that _
well _ they _ were _
there _ was _ uh _
apparently _ the _ specifications _ for _ the _ joints _ uh _
they _ were _ not _ to _ perform _ in _ uh _ cold _ weather _
and _ uh E apparently _ there _ was _ definitely _ a E a _ joint _ that _ did _ not _ seal _
and _ uh _ if _ you _ 've _ ever _ seen _ the _ size _ of _ those _ uh _ motors _ that _ put _ them _ into _ space _
uh-huh _
i _ mean _ they _ 're _ as _ long _ as _ a _ football _ field _ practically _ and _ about _ twelve _ foot _ in _ diameter _
uh-huh _
and E and _ there _ is _ a _ lot E of E pressure E lot _ of _ thrust _ to _ get _ that _ much _ weight _ up _ in _ the _ air _
oh _ yeah _
so _ it E 's E this _ book _ was _ interesting _ though _
i _ uh _
talked _ about _ how _ a _ lot _ of _ the _ problems _ they _ have _ to _ come _ overcome _ to _ uh _
it _ 's _ a _ very _ complex _ uh _ situation _ to _ go _ into _ space _
oh _ yeah _
i _ would _ think _ so _ too _
they _ would _
the _ thing _ that _ he _ went _ into _ quite _ a _ bit _ of _ detail _ about _ how E how _ much _ of _ a _ problem _ it _ is _ to _ re-enter _ the _ earth _ 's _ atmosphere _
you _ never _ think _ about _ that _ do _ you _
yeah _
i _ would _ think _ it _ would _ be _ harder _ to _ get _ up _ than _ it _ would _ be _ getting _ back _ down _
yeah _
but _ they _ have _ to _ come _ in _ at _ a E just _ the _ right _ angle _
if _ you _ come _ in _ at _ the _ wrong _ angle _ what _ happens _ is _ they _ bounce _ off _ and _ go _ back _ into _ space _
uh-huh _
and _ if _ they _ come _ into _ it _ at _ a _ different _ angle _ there _ is _ so _ much _ friction _ that _ it _ burns _ them _ up _
right _
so _
well _ i _ saw _ one _ of _ some _ of _ those _ early _ space _ capsules _ at _ smithsonian _
i _ 'm _ sure _ you _ 've _ seen _ more _ of _ them _ than _ i _ have _
oh _
but _ you _ could _ see _ the _ scorch _ on _ them _ you _ know _
uh-huh _
they _ had _ though _ piles _
yeah _
but _ you _ could _ see _ where _ they _ would _ come _ off _ in _ the _ how _ hot _ it _ got _ because _ it _ was _ still _ the _ scorch _ on _ them _ which _ was _ quite _ interesting _
yeah _
i E 've E i _ 've _ i _ would _ say _ i E 've E never E i _ 've _ never _ seen _ an _ actual _ capsule _
well _ i _
excuse _ me _ go _ ahead _
oh _ yeah _
i _ 've _ seen _ more E more _ of _ the _ motors _ that E that _ they _ produced _ out _ there _
uh-huh _
well E these _ were _ the _ ones _ that _ john _ glenn _ went _ up _ in _ you _ know _ and _ the _ old E old _ ones _
uh-huh _
yeah _
the _ very _ first _ ones _
the _ little _ bell _ type _ things _
people _ have _ commented _ how _ uh _ they _ were _ surprised _ at _ how _ small _ they _ were _
yeah _
they _ really _ were _
they _ just _ uh _
looked _ pretty _ confining _ huh _
oh _ yeah _
and _ uh _ the _ whole _ thing _ was _ small _
and _ yeah E you E i _ mean _ you _ actually _ put _ it _ on _ you _ know _
is _ that _ right _
you _ put _ it _ around _ you _ pretty _ much _
it _ was _ so _ small _
huh _
well _ i _ thought _ there _ was _ some _ medical _ benefits _ that _ we _ have _ learned _ from _ space _
but _ did _ he _ go _ into _ that _ in _ the _ book _
not _ really _ uh _
i _ guess _ that _ 's _ just _ to _ sell _ us _ on _ it _
one _ thing _ 's _
i _ know _ one _ thing _ they E 've E they _ 've _ mentioned _ that _ i _ did _ n't _ get _ from _ the _ book _ by _ the _ way _
but _ it _ talked _ about _ uh _
they _ 're _ able _ to _ manufacture _ uh E different _ kinds _ of _ crystals _ and _ ball _ bearings _ and _ things _ like _ that _ in _ a _ zero _ gravity _ state _ that _ they _ turned _ out _ being _ almost E uh E nearly _ perfect _ as _ far _ as _ a _ ball _ bearing _ goes _
oh _ yeah _
it _ 's _ perfectly _ round _
uh-huh _
but _ i _ 'm _ not _ sure _ you _ have _ to _ go _ to _ outer _ space _ to _ achieve _ that _ zero _ gravity _
well _ that _ 's _ true _
and _
yeah _
that _ 's _ right _
well _ do _ you _ think _ we _ should _ continue _ to _ support _ it _ at _ the _ level _
well _ i _ thought _ probably _ one _ of _ the _ things _ they _ were _ doing _ that _ they _ did _ n't _ tell _ us _ was _ spying _
because _ i _ think _ those _ satellites _ you _ know _ or _ not _ satellites _ but _ the _ spaceflights _ could _ really _ spy _
uh-huh _
and _ with E uh E with _ russia _ 's _ demise _ i _ did _ n't _ know _ if _ we _ should _ continue _ to _ support _ it _ at _ the _ current _ level _
yes _
uh E i _ think _ they _ have _ cut _ it _ back _ to _ be _ honest _ with _ you _ from E from _ the _ glory _ days _ when _ they _ did _ the _ apollo _ shots _ to _ the _ moon _
yeah _
uh _
uh _ i _ appreciate _ having _ the _ satellites _
you _ know _ that _ 's _ certainly _ made _ it _ nice _ for _ other _ purpose _
i _ do _ n't _ know _ if _ you _ have _ a _ satellite _ dish _ or _ not _
we _ do _ n't _
no _
i _ do _ n't _
i _ do _ n't _ either _
but _ i E i _ know _ that _ 's _ certainly _ helped _ a _ lot _ in _ that _ regard _ uh E
yeah _
well _ the _ topic _ 's _ about _ government _
uh _ i _ 'm _ not _ altogether _ sure _ that _ that _ 's _ my _ best _ topic _ uh _
i _ thought _ it _ was _ kind _ of _ a _ strange _ topic _ about _ corruption _ in _ the _ government _ and _ uh _ how _ many _ people _ are _ self _ serving _
yeah _
uh-huh _
i _ mean _ you E i _ i _ think _ people _ tend _ to _ think _ that _ the _ government _ is _ not _ corrupt _ and _ that _ people _ are _ n't _ self _ serving _
uh-huh _
uh-huh _
uh-huh _
i _ mean _ that _ 's _ what _ i _ would _ like _ to _ think _
yeah _
i E i _ i _ think _ that _ the _ last _ uh E part _ of _ that _ question _ was _ particularly _ interesting _ uh E about _ uh E uh E uh E can _ all _ unethical _ behavior _ or _ how _ much _ unethical _ behavior _ can _ be _ made _ illegal _ uh E because _ it _ seems _ to _ me _ that _ when _ uh E government _ or _ public _ service _ of _ any _ kind _ degenerates _ so _ much _ that _ you _ have _ to _ have _ so _ many _ explicit _ ethical _ codes _ uh E parallel _ to _ the _ legal _ codes _ that _ uh E we _ 're _ focusing _ on _ the _ wrong _ thing _
uh-huh _
uh-huh _
uh-huh _
yeah _
maybe E maybe _ that _ 's _ what _ is _ happening _
maybe _ so _ many _ things _ have _ become _ public _ with _ the _ media _ over _ the _ past _ you _ know _ ten _ to _ twenty _ years _ that _ uh _ it _ becomes _ more _ evident _
perhaps _ things _ that _ we _ did _ n't _ think _ of _ before _ and _ just _ concentrated _ on _ the _ lawmaking _ or _ the _ results _ that _ would _ be _ seen _ in _ public _ works _ or _ bills _ that _ are _ passed _ or _ you _ know _ et _ cetera _ like _ that _
uh-huh _
and _ we _ were _ just _ not _ exposed _ to _ the _ personal _ lives _ of _ these _ persons _
uh-huh _
and _ i _ could _ n't _ help _ thinking _ when E that E last E it _ was _ a _ funny _ question _ when _ that _ last _ part _ of _ the _ question _ came _ about _ how _ many _ things _ can _ we _ uh E actually _ put _ a _ legal _ code _ on _ that _ uh E how _ much _ uh E should _ it _ be _ our _ uh E prerogative _ to _ see _ into _ the _ private _ lives _ of _ these _ people _ you _ know _
uh-huh _
uh-huh _
yeah _
yeah _
that _ makes _ sense _
um _
because _ you _ start _ prying _ in _ people _ 's _ private _ lives _ you _ ruin _ their _ lives _ as _ well _ as _
that _ 's _ right _
and _ sometimes _ you _ know _ i _ do _ n't _ even _ know _ how _ much _ of _ a _ difference _ it _ really _ makes _ you _ know _
yeah _
i _ mean _ i _ guess _ in _ some _ cases _ sure _ we _ care _ about _ what _ they _ did _ in _ the _ past _
uh-huh _
but _ uh _ sometimes _ i _ do _ n't _ know _
uh-huh _
i _ think _ it _ gets _ in _ the _ way _ of _ the _ better _ judgment _
i _ mean _ just _ because _ you _ did _ something _ in _ the _ past _ does _ n't _ mean _ he _ 's _ not _ a _ good _ enough _ person _ to _ be _ a _ politician _
i E i _ i _ agree _ with _ that _ and E uh E and _ also _ that _ if _ the _ results _ that _ they _ 're _ putting _ out _ and _ what _ they _ actually _ seem _ to _ be _ accomplishing _ by _ legitimate _ means _ is _ what _ 's _ you _ know _ going _ to _ the _ public _ then E uh E then _ they _ 'll _ pay _ for _ their _ private _ life _ in _ their _ own _ private _ conscience _
uh-huh _
uh-huh _
that _ 's _ it _
and _ uh E you E when _ it _ becomes _ public _ though _ it _ becomes _ scandalous _
uh-huh _
yeah _
the E that _ 's _ that _ 's _ the _ thing _ that _
uh E things _ that _ you _ do _ n't _ know _ uh E do E do _ not _ worm _ their _ way _ around _ and _ influence _ other _ people _ or _ perhaps _ lead _ other _ people _ astray _
uh-huh _
yeah _
people _ could _ say _ oh _ they _ do _ it _
so _ i _ guess _ you _ know _
but _ as _ soon _ as _ things _ do _ get _ public _ uh E there E there _ is _ that _ terrible _ concern _
uh-huh _
um _
so _ sometimes _ i _ ask _ myself _ what _ are _ uh _ people _ doing _ that _ are _ in _ the _ media _ when _ somebody _ you _ know _ comes _ up _ to _ office _
uh-huh _
it _ seems _ that _ one _ of _ the _ first _ thing _ that _ 's _ done _ is _ to _ dig _ up _ any _ kind _ of _ a _ thing _ they _ can _ on _ them _ and _ get _ it _ all _ over _ the _ headlines _
uh-huh _
oh _ yeah _
i _ guess _ it _ 's _ what _ sells _ newspapers _ you _ know _
it _ 's _ a _ very _ low _ way _ of _ living _
uh-huh _
uh _ so _
and E and _ and _ as _ far _ as _ uh E you _ know _ myself _ having _ any _ particular _ personal _ uh E knowledge _ or _ insight _ into _ politics _ or _ politicians _ it E i _ 'm _ not _ terribly _ involved _ in _ it _
uh-huh _
just _ in _ a _ very _ cursory _ way _
right _
i _ vote _
and _ i _ you _ know _ try _ to _ do _ whatever _ i _ can _ on _ the _ little _ local _ area _
but _ i E i _ it _ just _ is _ not _ one _ of _ the _ things _ that _ i _ have _ uh E placed _ uh E uh E a E a _ lot _ of _ my _ particular _ time _ and _ effort _ into _
yeah _
so _ i E i _ always _ feel _ very _ outside _ this E kind E of E uh E this _ kind _ of _ an _ issue _
uh-huh _
yeah _
but _ uh _
i _ am _ kind _ of _ the _ same _ way _
i _ just _ kind _ of _ read _ the _ paper _ follow E up E on E i _ mean _ you _ know _ just _ keep _ an _ eye _ on _ what _ 's _ going _ on _
yeah _
uh-huh _
yeah _
right _
but _ i _ do _ n't _ really _ play _ an _ active _ role _ in _ any _ kind _ of _ politics _
yeah _
uh _
uh _ uh-huh _
i E 'm E not E i _ 'm _ not _ in _ there _
i _ 'm _ not _ one _ of _ those _ uh _ you _ know _ volunteers _ that _ 's _ down _ at _ headquarters _ and _ whatever _ uh _ although _ i _ admire _ the _ people _ that _ do _ that _
and _ they _ certainly _ do _ get _ inside _ information _
uh-huh _
and _ uh E of _ course _ the E better E you _ know _ a _ person _ that _ might _ be _ affiliated _ with _ that _ kind _ of _ thing _ the _ more _ you _ can _ trust _ their E their _ judgment _ and _ their _ insight _
right _
right _
uh-huh _
but _ the _ media _ insight _ as _ you _ said _
i _ just _ kind _ of _ read _ and _ kind _ of _ be _ aware _
yeah _
and _ then _ uh _ i _ do _ n't _ like _ to _ make _ a _ whole _ lot _ of _ uh _ judgment _ myself _ unless _ things _ are _ so _ absolutely _ out _ of _ whack _ that _ uh _
yeah _
all _ right _
well _ do _ you _ play _ any _ musical _ instruments _ or _
no _
i _ do _ n't _ play _ any _
i _ used _ to _
oh _ well _
i _ think _ everybody _ took _ piano _ lessons _
so _
everybody _
sure _
i E i _ started _ when _ i _ was _ in _ uh E third _ grade _
and _ i E 've E i _ still _ play _ the _ piano _ as _ of _ today _
do _ you _
yes _
i _ do _
i _ started _
i _ think _ i _ was _ in _ the _ fifth _ grade _
and _ i _ played _ it _ for _ maybe _ three _ months _
but _ then _ again _ i _ was _ also _ in _ uh _ the _ marching _ band _
i _ played _ the _ drums _
i _ played _ the _ clarinet _
i _ played _ the _ trumpet _
wow _
uh _ you _ know _ whatever _
and _ so _ i E i _ still _ sing _
and _ i _ sing _ in _ the _ choir _ today _
so _
all _ right _
i E i _ enjoy _ the _ music _
it _ gives _ me _ an _ out _
yeah _
it _ always _ sounds _ like _
for _ my _ playing _ the _ piano _ when _ i _ was _ depressed _ and _ did _ n't _ have _ anything _ else _ to _ do _ and _ there _ was _ no _ one _ to _ play _ with _ i _ could _ always _ go _ play _ with _ the _ piano _ you _ know _
true _
so _ how _ long _ did _ you _ play _
only _ for _ about _ three _ months _
three _ months _
yeah _
me _ and _ my _ brother _ both _ took _ the _ classes _
and _ we _ got _ pretty _ bored _ quick _
i _ was _ going _ to _ say _ you _ got _ as _ far _ as _ the _ uh _ chop _ sticks _ huh _
um _ well _ i _ could _ play _ uh _ the _ wood _ chuck _ song _
oh _ the _ wood _ chuck _ song _
and _ i _ still _ can _ to _ this _ date _
and _ your _ mother _ 's _ saying _ and E although _ the _ money _ that _ we _ spent _ for _ those _ piano _ lessons _ this _ is _ all _ we _ got _ was _ the _ wood _ chuck _ song _
yeah _
yep _
they _ went _ out _ and _ bought _ us _ a _ piano _
and _ for _ three _ months _
oh _ bless _ your _ heart _
did E you E ever E did _ you _ ever _ just _ bang _ on _ it _ or _ do _ anything _ with _ it _ at _ all _
oh _ yeah _
any _ time _ i _ got _ bored _
oh _ okay _
but _ i _ mean _ can _ you _ play _ anything _ on _ it _ other _ than _ wood _ chuck _ song _
no _
no _
and _ jaws _
but _ i _ think _ everybody _ can _
okay _
i E i _ i _ can _ still _ read _ music _ if _ i _ 'm _ lucky _
because _ i _
if _ i _ work _ real _ hard _ i _ can _ still _ barely _ read _ the _ music _
but _ see _ i _ played _ the _ piano _ from _ the _ third _ grade _ all _ the _ way _ through _ high _ school _
yeah _
so _
yeah _
i _ played _ uh _ concertos _ and _ other _ stuff _
but _
i _ got _ to _ the _ point _ where _ i _ was _ n't _ really _ reading _ music _ i _ was _ memorizing _ music _
so _ because _ of _ that _ i _ ca _ n't _ read _ music _ as _ well _ as _ i _ used _ to _
but _ anyway _
yeah _
but _ i _ enjoy _ it _ though _
i _ find _ it _ to _ be _ a _ good _ out _
and _ i _ still _ enjoy _ the _ marching _ band _
and _ i _ still _ enjoy _ uh _ singing _ in _ the _ choir _
so _
do _ you _ sing _ at _ choir _ at _ your _ church _
yes _
i _ do _
yeah _
yes _
i _ do _
that _ 's _
in _ fact _ that _ 's _ about _ the _ only _ musical _ thing _ that _ i _ still _ do _ is _ sing _ in _ the _ choir _
yeah _
i _ tried _ out _ for _ choir _ when _ i _ was _ think _ in _ the _ seventh _ grade _
and _ they _ would _ n't _ let _ me _ in _
so _ i _ never _ tried _ again _
well _ i _ sing _ in _ the _ choir _
i _ do _ know _ if _ they _ want _ me _ to _ or _ not _
but _ at _ least _ i _ do _ sing _ in _ it _
yeah _
that _ 's _ pretty _ good _
well _
i _ never _ really _ learned _ the _ music _ or _ anything _
i _ never _ learned _
i _ got _ right _ to _ where _ i _ was _ figuring _ out _ where _ all _ the _ keys _ were _ on _ the _ piano _
and _ that _ 's _ about _ when _ i _ quit _
i _ was _ at _
i _ actually _ went _ to _ the _ university _ of _ texas _ at _ one _ time _ thinking _ that _ i _ would _ be _ a _ musician _
i _ wanted _ to _ be _ a _ high _ school _ band _ director _
yeah _
but _ after _ one _ semester _ of _ that _ i _ said _ no _ no _
this _ is _ n't _ for _ me _
enjoy _ it _ but _ not _ for _ profession _ no _
yeah _
and _ besides _ that _ i _ kind _ of _ learned _ i _ was _ n't _ really _ that _ good _
i _ gave _ up _
yeah _
course _ my _ mom _ thought _ i _ was _
but _ uh _ you _ know _
of _ course _
parents _ always _ do _
oh _ yeah _
so _
they _ 're _ nice _ that _ way _
yes _
well _ what _ else _ can _ we _ uh _ talk _ about _
uh _
uh _ well _ i _ do _ n't _
so _ you _ listen _ to _ kind _ of _ church _ music _ gospel _
no _
no _
i E i _ listen _ to _ k _ v _ i _ l _
oh _ yeah _
yeah _
yeah _
so _ i _ listen _ to _ the _ radio _
i _ like _ the _ pop _ music _
oh _ yeah _
i _ like _ people _ like _ neil _ diamond _ and _ all E all _ the _ folks _ that _ you _ 're _ not _ supposed _ to _ like _
but _ that _ 's _ who _ i _ go _ for _
oh _ yeah _
the _ jeezer _ music _ as _ i _ call _ it _
oh _ the _ jeezer _ music _
yeah _
oh _ okay _
well _
my _ boss _ listens _ to _ that _
we _ listen _ to _ ninety-seven _ point _ nine _
and _ that _ 's _ his _ station _ so _ i _ call _ it _ the _ jeezer _ music _
okay _
now _ what _ kind _ of _ music _ do _ you _ listen _ to _
well _ i _ listen _ to _ like _ ninety-seven _ point _ one _ you _ know _ more _
what E what _ is _ that _
it _ 's _ more _ uh _
i _ do _ n't _ know _ how _ to _ explain _ it _
kind _ of _ pop _ you _ know _ rock _
rock _
yeah _
hard _ rock _
well _ not _ hard _
not _ hard _ rock _
just _ kind _ of _
not _ like _ the _ eagle _
huh _
is _ that _ the _ eagle _
yeah _
okay _
i E know E i _ know _ what _ the _ eagle _ is _
it _ 's _ not _ too _ hard _
it _ 's _
that _ 's _ not _ too _ hard _
you _ know _
but _ it _ 's _ not _ enough _ to _ put _ you _ to _ sleep _
true _
true _
which _ some _ of _ the _ songs _ on _ k _ v _ i _ l _ can _
well _ course _ see _ i _ listen _ to _ k _ v _ i _ l _ for _ the _ contests _
i _ mean _
oh _ yeah _
got _ the _ bumper _ sticker _ too _
oh _ yes _
oh _ yes _
you _ ca _ n't _ drive _ a _ car _ without _ bumper _ sticker _
and _ you _ know _ they _ 're _ going _ to _ call _ you _ up _
someday _
yeah _
well _ listen _ i _ 've _ enjoyed _ talking _
i E i _ 'm _ sure _ that _ the _ switchboard _ will _ probably _ give _ us _ that _ sign _ off _ message _ very _ shortly _ anyway _
okay _
i _ appreciate _ it _
okay _
catch _ you _ later _
bye-bye _
bye-bye _
